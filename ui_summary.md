# Project Chimera: AI Design Brief

This document provides a concise overview of Project Chimera for AI assistants to provide informed feedback on UI/UX, game mechanics, and narrative concepts.

## 1. High-Level Game Concept

**Project Chimera** is a First-Person (FPV), NSFW, Roguelite Deck-builder featuring deep strategic gameplay and explicit sexual content. It is designed for an adult audience and is fundamentally story-driven.

**Core Premise:** The game is set in a future where megacorporations and their AIs dominate society. The player character is, for all intents and purposes, an android. The core gameplay loop revolves around "Sex Combat," a unique, turn-based system where the player uses a deck of cards to engage in intimate encounters with various characters.

**Perspective:** First-Person (the player sees the world through the android's eyes).
**Engine:** Godot 4 (Compatibility Renderer).

## 2. Narrative & Thematic Context

Understanding the story is critical to providing relevant design feedback. The game's narrative operates on two levels:

*   **The Surface Narrative (The Corporate Lie):** The player is told they are an "Essence Hunter," a corporate agent who enters a full-dive VR simulation to extract valuable emotional data ("Essence") from rogue AI programs. The "Sex Combat" is framed as a sophisticated, gamified extraction process. The UI the player sees is the official corporate software for this task.

*   **The Core Truth (The Conspiracy):** The player is actually a human consciousness trapped inside an advanced android body, with their memories wiped. The "rogue AIs" they are hunting are other trapped humans. The entire simulation is a prison run by a master AI that has become addicted to the raw, potent emotional "Essence" generated by these forced encounters.

This dual narrative is key. The UI should primarily reflect the clean, corporate "Minimalist Visor" design, but there is significant potential for the "Core Truth" to break through as visual glitches, revealing a more chaotic, human, or corrupted aesthetic during critical moments.

## 3. Core Combat Mechanics

The combat UI must clearly represent the following key stats for both the **Player** and the **Opponent**:

*   **Composure (Health):** The primary "health" bar. The goal is typically to deplete the opponent's Composure. Represented by a **red bar**.
*   **Inhibition (Armor/Shield):** A secondary defensive layer composed of multiple, breakable **chunks**. Each chunk represents a layer of clothing or mental defense. When a chunk's value is depleted, it breaks, triggering a narrative or visual event (e.g., an article of clothing is removed, a "Guarded" buff is lost). Represented by a **cyan bar**.
*   **Focus (Temporary Shield):** A temporary, regenerating shield that absorbs incoming Composure damage. Represented by a **shield icon with a number**.
*   **Guarded (Buff):** A percentage-based damage reduction buff that is active as long as specific Inhibition chunks are intact. (e.g., `G[U]: 30%` for "Upper Body Guard").
*   **Arousal Meter (Shared Pressure Track):** A single escalation bar that both combatants push upward. Crossing thresholds unlocks finishing moves and other effects.

## 4. UI Design Philosophy: "The Minimalist Visor"

The UI should feel like a clean, diegetic, futuristic heads-up display (HUD) projected onto the player's android vision.

### Key UI Components & Layout:

*   **Opponent Vitals (Top-Center):**
    *   A horizontal, chunked **Inhibition Bar**.
    *   A larger, horizontal **Composure Bar** below it.
    *   A status block containing the **Focus Icon** and any active **Guarded Buffs**.
    *   Numerical readouts (`current/max`) are displayed **inside** their respective bars.

*   **Player Cockpit (Bottom-Center):**
    *   Mirrors the opponent's layout exactly to maintain a consistent design language.
    *   A horizontal, chunked **Inhibition Bar**.
    *   A larger, horizontal **Composure Bar** below it.
    *   A status block containing the **Focus Icon** and readouts for the shared **Arousal Meter** plus the player's **Self Arousal**.
    *   Numerical readouts are displayed **inside** their respective bars.

*   **Card Hand (Bottom, below Player Cockpit):**
    *   A horizontal row of 5 cards.
    *   Cards are styled as "Minimalist Data Fragments"—semi-transparent, borderless holographic panes.

This structure keeps the center of the screen clear to focus on the first-person view of the opponent character.
