# [2.3.2] NPC Design Philosophy

This document outlines the core principles and mechanics governing all Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in encounters, ensuring consistency in design and difficulty scaling.

## "Human-First" Design Mandate
All NPCs, regardless of their in-world status (trapped human, willing corporate tester, rival EH), are designed to look, act, and react like believable, sentient humans. This is to maintain the player's immersion and the game's grounded, realistic tone from the player's point of view. NPC actions will be direct, physical, and sensual to align with the game's explicit NSFW nature.

## Asymmetrical Action Design
NPCs do not use cards or the player's `Tension`/`Arousal` resource system. Their turns are driven by a pre-set pool of **Abilities** governed by an AI script or behavior tree. The complexity of this script and the power of the abilities are the primary levers for balancing NPC difficulty.

*   **Tiered Difficulty:**
    *   **Low-Tier NPCs:** Will have a small pool of low-impact abilities and simple AI logic. Their goal is to test the player's understanding of basic mechanics.
    *   **Mid-Tier NPCs:** Will have a larger ability pool, including abilities that apply debuffs or have more complex conditional effects.
    *   **Bosses / Rival EHs:** Will have a complex AI "behavior tree." They will actively "build up" to powerful moves or change their strategy based on the game state, creating a dynamic challenge that mimics a player's strategic thinking.

*   **NPC Positional Actions:** High-tier NPCs and bosses may have access to their own powerful **`Position`-like ultimate abilities.** When used, these could initiate a unique "sub-phase" where the player is on the defensive, forced to react to a new set of dangerous actions until they can "break" the NPC's hold. This serves as a major difficulty spike and a test of the player's defensive capabilities.

## Core NPC Stats & Resources

| Resource      | Tier 1 NPC Range | Tier 3 / Boss Range | Persistence             | Description                                                                              |
| :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Composure** | 80 - 120         | 250 - 500+          | **Resets Each Encounter** | The NPC's "health" for the fight.                                                        |
| **Inhibition**  | 40 - 100         | 150 - 300+          | **Resets Each Encounter** | The NPC's "armor." The starting value and thresholds are determined by their specific outfit. |
| **Focus**       | Variable         | Variable            | **Degrades**            | NPCs can have defensive abilities that grant them temporary `Focus` shields. This shield also degrades by half (rounded down) at the end of the NPC's turn. |

## Example NPC Snapshot: Analyst Sarah (Tier 1)

*   **Composure:** 80
*   **Inhibition:** 40 (Threshold: Topless < 20 `I`)
*   **Guarded Values:** `G[U]: 3`, `G[L]: 3`
*   **Key Abilities:** `Breast Squeeze & Giggle` (-8 Player `Composure`), `Check Your Hardware` (-10 Player `Inhibition`), `Deep Breath & Hair Toss` (+10 Self `Focus`), `Begin Oral Exam` (-24 Player `Composure`, requires Player to be `Exposed`).
