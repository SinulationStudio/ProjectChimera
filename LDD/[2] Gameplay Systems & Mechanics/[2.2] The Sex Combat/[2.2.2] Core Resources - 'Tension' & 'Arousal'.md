# [2.2.2] Core Resources: `Tension` & `Arousal`

To create deep, strategic gameplay, the player must manage two distinct in-encounter resources. These resources are generated by "Generator" cards and consumed by powerful "Spender" cards. Both resources reset to 0 at the beginning of each encounter.

## `Tension` (The Mental Resource)
*   **Represents:** Psychological pressure, emotional manipulation, verbal seduction, and the build-up of anticipation.
*   **Generated By:** Primarily generated by cards with the `Verbal` keyword (e.g., `Make Her Blush`).
*   **Purpose:**
    1.  **Fueling "Psychologist" Playstyles:** Used as a cost for powerful `Verbal` Spender cards that can apply debuffs, disrupt the opponent's actions, or deal significant `Composure` damage that bypasses `Guarded` defenses.
    2.  **Amplifying Physicality:** High amounts of `Tension` can be used to augment `Intimate` cards, either as an alternative cost or through an **`Amplify`** keyword (e.g., "Amplify Tension 2:1 - Deals +2 Composure for every 1 Tension you have"). This ensures `Tension` remains a valuable resource throughout the entire encounter.
*   **Max Value:** 100 (Soft Cap).

## `Arousal` (The Physical Resource)
*   **Represents:** Direct physical stimulation, sensual touch, and the build-up to raw sexual energy.
*   **Generated By:** Primarily generated by cards with the `Physical` keyword (e.g., `Caress Her Thigh`). Note: `Arousal` generation is reduced by the target's `Guarded` buff.
*   **Purpose:**
    1.  **Fueling "Physician" Playstyles:** Used as the primary cost for high-damage `Physical` and `Intimate` Spender cards (`Fondle Her Breasts`, `Position:` cards).
    2.  **Unlocking Climax:** The most powerful physical acts require a significant investment in `Arousal`, making it the key resource for finishing an encounter decisively once an opponent's `Inhibition` is broken.
*   **Max Value:** 100 (Soft Cap).

## The Strategic Dichotomy
The dual-resource system is the foundation of the game's strategic depth. Players are free to:
*   **Specialize:** Focus on a pure `Tension` build to win through psychological warfare or a pure `Arousal` build for overwhelming physical offense.
*   **Hybridize:** Build a deck that generates both resources to set up powerful combos, using `Tension` to create openings and `Arousal` to exploit them.

This system prevents a single "best" strategy and encourages diverse deck-building and adaptive playstyles.
