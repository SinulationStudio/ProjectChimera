# [2.2.1] Encounter Flow & The Escalation State System

This document details the moment-to-moment flow and visual progression of a Sex Combat encounter, designed to create a cinematic and immersive experience.

## Core Philosophy: The Cinematic Turn
Every action taken by the player or NPC is treated as a short, cinematic event. We prioritize a "Show, Don't Tell" approach, relying on high-quality First-Person View (FPV) animations and sound design to convey the action, rather than intrusive UI text. The goal is to make the player feel present in a continuous, escalating scene, not like they are playing on a static game board.

## The "Escalation State" System
To combat the feeling of repetitive animations returning to a single "neutral" pose, the baseline state of the encounter dynamically evolves as the fight progresses. This is governed by an invisible `Intensity` meter that fills as cards are played and damage is dealt. When the meter crosses pre-set thresholds, the "neutral pose" of both characters permanently changes for the remainder of the encounter.

This creates a clear visual narrative of the encounter's progression.

### **Intensity Level 1: "The Approach"**
*   **Trigger:** Start of the encounter (0-24 Intensity).
*   **Neutral Pose:** Characters are at a conversational distance (e.g., across a desk, on opposite ends of a couch).
*   **Animation Context:** Actions are initiated from this distance. Physical contact involves one character deliberately closing the space before returning to the neutral pose. The tone is one of initial probing and testing boundaries.

### **Intensity Level 2: "Close Quarters"**
*   **Trigger:** Intensity meter crosses 25. A brief transition animation plays where the characters move closer.
*   **Neutral Pose:** Characters are now within arm's reach of each other, in each other's personal space.
*   **Animation Context:** The same card plays have new animations reflecting the increased proximity. A `Whisper a Filthy Promise` is now delivered directly to the ear. A `Caress Her Thigh` is more immediate and intimate.

### **Intensity Level 3: "The Embrace"**
*   **Trigger:** Intensity meter crosses 50.
*   **Neutral Pose:** Characters are now in a standing or sitting embrace, chest-to-chest. This is the height of non-explicit physical intimacy.
*   **Animation Context:** Actions are initiated from this embrace. A `Kiss Her Neck` is now deep and passionate. This state signifies that the encounter is becoming intensely physical.

### **Intensity Level 4: "Intimacy"**
*   **Trigger:** The NPC's `Inhibition` bar is fully depleted.
*   **Neutral Pose:** The scene permanently transitions to a more explicitly sexual setting (e.g., on a bed, against a wall). Both characters are now visually undressed.
*   **Animation Context:** This is the final phase of the fight. All `Intimate` cards are now playable and animate from this new, explicitly sexual context.
