# [2.2.2] Core Resource: The Arousal Meter

This system replaces the previously separated, mentally-focused combat structure; the encounter is built around a single, escalating resource. The `Tension` resource is now archived.

---

## Core Concept: A Status Effect

*   `Arousal` is not a resource to be "spent" by the player. It is a status effect (like `Poison` in *Slay the Spire*) that is applied to both the player and the opponent.
*   Several mechanical anchors define how it behaves:
    1.  **Accumulation:** The Arousal meter uses dual bars with the legacy X/100 scale, making the build-up readable at a glance.
    2.  **Reciprocal Pressure:** Many player cards use the `Apply X Arousal` keyword to raise the opponent's meter. Some cards allow the player to build `Self Arousal` as a trade-off.
    3.  **Finisher Thresholds:** When the opponent crosses key thresholds (e.g., 33/66/100), it unlocks different classes of `Intimate` finisher cards.
    4.  **Amplify Hooks:** Several abilities reference the target's current `Arousal` to scale damage or secondary effects.

## Primary Function: The `Amplify` Keyword

*   `Amplify` now refers to using the opponent's `Arousal` for finishers, using the format `Amplify Arousal X:Y`.
    *   *Example:* `Heartbreaker Feint` – Deal 8 `Composure`. `Amplify Arousal 3:1` — for every 3 `Arousal`, deal +1 additional `Composure` loss.
*   Select rare cards use `Self Amplify` to reward risky plays that convert the player's own `Arousal` into burst damage or utility.

## Decay & Resolution

*   `Arousal` does **not** passively decay. Once applied, it stays until converted into other effects or the encounter ends.
*   Certain `Mental` cards can temporarily **suppress** Arousal gains for a turn, delaying threshold triggers. This is represented by a new debuff, `Suppressed`.

## Example Cards

*   **`Neon Edge` (Basic):** Apply 8 `Arousal`. Gain 10 `Guard`. `Amplify Arousal 2:1` — Deal +2 `Composure`.
*   **`Breath Control` (Support):** Remove your `Self Arousal`. Gain 20 `Guard`.
*   **`Overload` (Finisher):** Deal 20 `Composure`. If the opponent has 66+ `Arousal`, add +10 `Composure`. If at 100 `Arousal`, resolve a `Climax` effect.

This single-meter approach keeps tension building in one direction, streamlining encounter pacing while preserving the fantasy of escalating intimacy.
