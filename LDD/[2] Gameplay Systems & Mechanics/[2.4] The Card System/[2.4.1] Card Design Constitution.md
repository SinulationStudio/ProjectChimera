# [2.4.1] Card Design Constitution

This document outlines the three core principles that must be applied to the design of every player card in Project Cygnus. These rules ensure that all cards are clear, intuitive, thematically resonant, and technically feasible within our GenAI-driven art pipeline.

## Principle 1: The "Silhouette Test" (Clarity & Intuition)

*   **Core Question:** Does the card's **name alone** strongly imply its function, flavor, and target?
*   **Mandate:** A player should have a good "gut feeling" about what a card does before reading its effect text. The name must be unambiguous. This principle ensures that the card's theme and mechanics are instantly understandable.

*   **Passing Examples:**
    *   `Fondle Her Breasts`: Clearly a `Physical` card targeting the `[Upper Body]`.
    *   `Whisper a Filthy Promise`: Clearly a `Verbal` card with a psychological effect.
    *   `Steel Your Nerves`: Clearly a `Defensive` or `Mental` card that affects the player.

*   **Failing Examples:**
    *   `Vague Advance`: Does not specify the type or target of the action.
    *   `Leer` / `Gaze`: Actions are too subtle and difficult to distinguish mechanically.
    *   `Compliment Her Blue Eyes`: Fails because it is not universal and relies on specific NPC features.

## Principle 2: Mechanical & Thematic Harmony (Balance & Logic)

*   **Core Question:** Do the card's **costs** (AP, `Tension`, `Arousal`) and **effects** (`Composure` damage, buffs, etc.) feel **logically proportional** to the action described by its name?
*   **Mandate:** The mechanics must make intuitive, real-world sense. This grounds the game and makes the systems feel fair and logical, not arbitrary. The power of a card must be reflected in its cost.

*   **Passing Examples:**
    *   A high-cost `Position:` card has a massive, encounter-altering effect.
    *   A simple `Verbal` generator card deals low `Composure` damage because its primary purpose is to break `Inhibition` and generate `Tension`.
    *   A high-cost `Intimate` spender deals immense `Composure` damage, representing a climactic physical act.

*   **Failing Examples:**
    *   `Gentle Kiss` dealing more damage than `Aggressive Thrust`.
    *   A 0 AP card that deals 50 damage with no other cost or downside.

## Principle 3: "The Prompt Test" (GenAI Feasibility & Universality)

*   **Core Question:** Can the action be described in a **simple, universal prompt** that will generate a clear and consistent visual for *any* female NPC from a first-person perspective?
*   **Mandate:** Every card's action must be visually representable in a way that is universal across all NPC body types, hair styles, and features. This is a critical technical constraint to ensure our art pipeline is feasible.

*   **Passing Examples:**
    *   `Brush Hair from Face`: Works regardless of hair length or style. The *action* is universal.
    *   `Kiss Her Neck`: Every NPC has a neck. The framing is consistent.
    *   `Spank Buttocks`: The target is universal.

*   **Failing Examples:**
    *   `Play with Her Long Hair`: Fails if the NPC has short hair.
    *   `Admire Her Freckles`: Fails if the NPC has no freckles.
    *   `Unbutton Her Blouse`: Fails if the NPC is not wearing a button-up blouse or if the player is wearing a non-button shirt in a future female PC playthrough. Actions must be independent of specific clothing items.

By adhering to these three principles, we ensure that every card we create is intuitive, balanced, thematically appropriate, and, most importantly, **buildable.**
