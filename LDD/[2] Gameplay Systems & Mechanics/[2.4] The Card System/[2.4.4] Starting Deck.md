# [2.4.4] Starting Deck

This document details the 10-card starting deck for the player's default "Chassis." This deck is designed to be functional and educational, but ultimately underpowered, encouraging players to engage with the card reward and meta-progression systems to improve it.

## Design Philosophy
*   **Educational:** The deck contains cards that introduce every core mechanic: `Tension` & `Arousal` generation, resource spending, defense (`Focus`), and `[Upper Body]` vs. `[Lower Body]` targeting.
*   **Offense-Leaning Imbalance:** The deck is intentionally designed so that offensive actions are generally more AP-efficient than defensive ones, encouraging a proactive playstyle.
*   **"Designed to Fail":** While capable of winning early encounters with skillful play, this deck lacks the high-impact cards and strong synergies needed to reliably clear an entire run. This reinforces the "failure as progress" loop.

## Card Composition (10 Cards Total)

---
### **Generators (4 Cards)**

**1. `Make Her Blush` (x2)**
*   **Class:** `Verbal Technique`
*   **Cost:** 1 AP
*   **Effect:** Deal **4 `Composure`**. Generate **5 `Tension`**.
*   *Role:* The primary tool for generating `Tension` and reliably damaging `Inhibition` due to its `Verbal` nature.

**2. `Caress Her Thigh` (x2)**
*   **Class:** `Physical [Lower Body] Technique`
*   **Cost:** 1 AP
*   **Effect:** Deal **8 `Composure`**. Generate **4 `Arousal`**.
*   *Role:* The primary `Arousal` generator. Its high base damage is offset by being heavily penalized by `Guarded [Lower]` defenses, teaching the player about targeting weaknesses.

### **Spenders (2 Cards)**

**3. `Whisper a Filthy Promise` (x1)**
*   **Class:** `Verbal Technique`
*   **Cost:** 2 AP, **Cost: 15 `Tension`**
*   **Effect:** Deal **16 `Composure`**.
*   *Role:* The deck's dedicated `Tension` payoff. A consistent source of moderate damage that bypasses `Guarded` states.

**4. `Fondle Her Breasts` (x1)**
*   **Class:** `Physical [Upper Body] Technique`
*   **Cost:** 1 AP, **Cost: 12 `Arousal`**
*   **Effect:** Deal **22 `Composure`**.
*   *Role:* The deck's primary `Arousal` payoff. Rewards the player for breaking the `[Upper Body]` guard with a highly efficient burst of damage.

### **Utility & Defense (4 Cards)**

**5. `Steel Your Nerves` (x2)**
*   **Class:** `Defensive Technique`
*   **Cost:** 1 AP
*   **Effect:** Gain **8 `Focus`**.
*   *Role:* The sole defensive card. Its presence in hand is critical for mitigating damage and achieving "flawless" victories in early encounters.

**6. `Read Her Body Language` (x2)**
*   **Class:** `Mental Technique`
*   **Cost:** 0 AP
*   **Effect:** Generate **2 `Tension`** and **2 `Arousal`**. Draw 1 card.
*   *Role:* The deck's engine. A "cantrip" that thins the deck, smooths out resource generation, and helps the player cycle to their key Spender cards more quickly. Its value increases dramatically with player skill.
