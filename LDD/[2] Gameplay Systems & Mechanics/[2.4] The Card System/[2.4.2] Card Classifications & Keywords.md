# [2.4.2] Card Classifications & Keywords

This document serves as the official glossary for all card types, keywords, and status effects in Project Chimera.

---

## 1. Card Classifications

Every player card has two primary classifications that define its core function and flavor.

### **1.1. Action Type (The Card's "Verb")**

*   **`Technique`:** The most common card type. It produces a one-time effect and is then sent to the discard pile. This encompasses most standard offensive and defensive actions.
    *   *Example:* `Make Her Blush`, `Neon Edge`.

*   **`Position`:** A powerful and rare type of `Technique`. Playing a `Position:` card initiates a unique, high-impact "sub-game" or "grapple phase" with its own set of rules and temporary cards. They have extremely high costs and represent a major strategic investment.
    *   *Example:* `Position: Missionary`.

*   **`Stance`:** (Design Note: This type is under consideration but not in the MVE). A `Stance` would provide a persistent buff that lasts until another `Stance` card is played. You can only have one `Stance` active at a time.
    *   *Potential Example:* `Stance: Dominant`.

### **1.2. Interaction Method (The Card's "Flavor")**

*   **`Mental`:** Represents talking, teasing, and psychological manipulation—the "Subtitled Intent" style of pressure.
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* Primarily applies **`Arousal`** to the opponent or adds mental debuffs. Ignores `Guarded` but can be resisted by the `Resolved` buff.

*   **`Physical`:** Represents non-intercourse physical touch. This is further divided by target zone.
    *   **`Physical [Upper Body]`:** Targets the torso, chest, arms, and neck.
    *   **`Physical [Lower Body]`:** Targets the legs, hips, and groin area (over clothing).
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* Applies **`Arousal`** and can reduce `Guard [Zone]`. Penalized by the corresponding `Guarded` zone buff.

*   **`Intimate`:** Represents explicit sexual acts. These are typically high-cost "Spender" cards.
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* Almost always requires the target to be **`Exposed`** (0 `Inhibition`) to be played. These are the most powerful damage-dealing cards and often resolve `Climax` effects.

*   **`Defensive`:** Represents the player's internal state management.
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* Primary way to generate **`Guard`**, cleanse `Self Arousal`, or suppress incoming `Arousal` applications. Does not interact with the opponent directly unless stated.

## 2. Core Card Keywords

These are common keywords that will appear in a card's effect text to describe its behavior.

*   **`Apply X Arousal`:** Adds X points to the shared `Arousal Meter` on the target. (If the card targets the player, specify as `Apply X Self Arousal`.)
*   **`Reduce X Arousal`:** Removes X points from the target's `Arousal` (cannot go below 0).
*   **`Cleanse Self Arousal`:** Remove all `Self Arousal` you have accumulated.
*   **`Amplify Arousal X:Y`:** A bonus effect. For every Y points of the specified `Arousal` the target currently has, the card's effect is increased by X.
*   **`Exhaust`:** After this card is played, it is removed from play for the rest of the current encounter.
*   **`Retain`:** (To be used sparingly). This card is not discarded from your hand at the end of your turn.
*   **`Ethereal`:** (For generated cards). This card is discarded from your hand if it is not played by the end of your turn. `Exhausts` when played.

## 3. Core Status Effects (Buffs & Debuffs)

*   **`Vulnerable`:** The affected character takes +50% `Composure` loss from the next source of damage. Consumed after use.
*   **`Guard [Zone]: X`:** (Buff) Reduces incoming `Physical` damage to the specified zone by X*10 percent. Some cards reference `Guard Break` to reduce this value.
*   **`Resolved`:** (Buff) Temporarily reduces incoming `Mental` damage and prevents `Apply Self Arousal` effects.
*   **`Suppressed`:** (Debuff) The target cannot gain additional `Arousal` until the end of their next turn.
*   **`Exposed`:** (Debuff) The character's `Inhibition` is 0 and they have lost the `Guarded` buff.

This glossary provides the foundational language we will use to build and balance the entire card set.
