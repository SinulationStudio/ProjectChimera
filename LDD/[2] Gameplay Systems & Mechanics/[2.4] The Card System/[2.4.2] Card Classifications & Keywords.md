# [2.4.2] Card Classifications & Keywords

This document serves as the official glossary for all card types, keywords, and status effects in Project Cygnus.

## 1. Card Classifications

Every player card has two primary classifications that define its core function and flavor.

### **1.1. Action Type (The Card's "Verb")**

*   **`Technique`:** The most common card type. It produces a one-time effect and is then sent to the discard pile. This encompasses most standard offensive and defensive actions.
    *   *Example:* `Make Her Blush`, `Fondle Her Breasts`.

*   **`Position`:** A powerful and rare type of `Technique`. Playing a `Position:` card initiates a unique, high-impact "sub-game" or "grapple phase" with its own set of rules and temporary cards. They have extremely high costs and represent a major strategic investment.
    *   *Example:* `Position: Missionary`.

*   **`Stance`:** (Design Note: This type is under consideration but not in the MVE). A `Stance` would provide a persistent buff that lasts until another `Stance` card is played. You can only have one `Stance` active at a time.
    *   *Potential Example:* `Stance: Dominant`.

### **1.2. Interaction Method (The Card's "Flavor")**

*   **`Verbal`:** Represents talking, teasing, and psychological manipulation.
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* Primarily generates or spends **`Tension`**. Is not affected by the `Guarded` buff, making it ideal for attacking `Inhibition`.

*   **`Physical`:** Represents non-intercourse physical touch. This is further divided by target zone.
    *   **`Physical [Upper Body]`:** Targets the torso, chest, arms, and neck.
    *   **`Physical [Lower Body]`:** Targets the legs, hips, and groin area (over clothing).
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* Primarily generates or spends **`Arousal`**. Is penalized by the corresponding `Guarded` zone buff.

*   **`Intimate`:** Represents explicit sexual acts. These are typically high-cost "Spender" cards.
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* Almost always requires the target to be **`Exposed`** (0 `Inhibition`) to be played. These are the most powerful damage-dealing cards.

*   **`Defensive`:** Represents the player's internal state management.
    *   *Mechanical Tie-in:* The primary way to generate **`Focus`** (shields). Does not interact with the opponent.
    *   *Note:* The keyword `Mental` was previously used but has been deprecated in favor of the more mechanically descriptive `Defensive`.

## 2. Core Card Keywords

These are common keywords that will appear in a card's effect text to describe its behavior.

*   **`Generate X [Resource]`:** Adds X points to the specified resource pool (e.g., `Generate 5 Tension`).
*   **`Cost X [Resource]`:** Requires and consumes X points from the specified resource pool to play this card or select its mode.
*   **`Amplify [Resource] X:Y`:** A bonus effect. For every Y points of the specified resource you currently have, the card's effect is increased by X. (e.g., `Amplify Arousal 1:1` - gain +1 damage for every 1 `Arousal`).
*   **`Exhaust`:** After this card is played, it is removed from play for the rest of the current encounter.
*   **`Retain`:** (To be used sparingly). This card is not discarded from your hand at the end of your turn.
*   **`Ethereal`:** (For generated cards). This card is discarded from your hand if it is not played by the end of your turn. `Exhausts` when played.

## 3. Core Status Effects (Buffs & Debuffs)

*   **`Vulnerable`:** The affected character takes +50% `Composure` loss from the next source of damage. Consumed after use.
*   **`Focus`:** (Buff) A temporary shield that absorbs incoming `Composure` loss. Degrades by half at end of turn.
*   **`Guarded [Zone]: X`:** (Buff) Reduces incoming `Physical` damage to the specified zone by X*10 percent.
*   **`Exposed`:** (Debuff) The character's `Inhibition` is 0 and they have lost the `Guarded` buff.

This glossary provides the foundational language we will use to build and balance the entire card set.
