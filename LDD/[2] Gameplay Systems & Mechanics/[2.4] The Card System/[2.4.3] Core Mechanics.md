[2.4.3] Core Mechanics: Card Flow & Deck Rules

This document defines the fundamental rules governing the player's deck, hand, and the flow of cards during an encounter. These rules are designed to create a fast-paced, tactical experience that prioritizes turn-by-turn decision making.

1. The Deck & Its Piles

The player's card collection during an encounter is managed across three primary zones.

Draw Pile: Contains all cards in the player's current deck that have not yet been drawn. At the start of an encounter, the full deck is in the Draw Pile.

Hand: The set of cards the player can play on their turn.

Discard Pile: Where cards are sent after being played or discarded from the hand. When the Draw Pile is empty and the player needs to draw a card, the Discard Pile is automatically shuffled to form a new Draw Pile.

2. Hand Management: "Full Discard & Dynamic Draw"

This system encourages playing cards aggressively and ensures a consistent flow of new options each turn.

Draw Rule (Revised): The number of cards drawn at the start of the player's turn is dynamic:

On Turn 1 of an encounter, the player draws a full hand of 5 cards.

On all subsequent turns, the draw rule is as follows:

If the player starts their turn with 4 or fewer cards in hand (due to Retain effects), they draw cards until their hand size is 5.

If the player starts their turn with 5 or more cards in hand, they draw exactly 1 card.

Discard Rule: At the end of the player's turn, all cards remaining in their hand are sent to the Discard Pile, unless they have the Retain keyword.

Maximum Hand Size: The player's hand is capped at 10 cards. If a draw effect would cause the player to exceed this limit, the card is drawn and then immediately sent to the Discard Pile ("burned").

3. The "Amplify" System (Replaces Modal Cards)

With the new "Single-Meter" system, the "Modal Card" (Generator/Spender) concept is obsolete. It is replaced by the Amplify Arousal keyword, which is the new core scaling mechanic.

Concept: Cards are no longer split into "Generators" and "Spenders." Instead, cards are classed by their function (Mental, Physical, Intimate) and their effects are scaled by the Arousal meter.

Keyword: Amplify Arousal X:Y

This is the primary way Arousal influences combat.

Effect: For every Y points of Arousal the player has, the card's effect is increased by X.

Example: A card with Amplify Arousal 1:2 (a 1-to-2 ratio) would grant +5 damage at 10 Arousal, +25 damage at 50 Arousal, and +50 damage at 100 Arousal.

Function: This system ensures that cards are rarely "dead draws." A Physical card is always useful to build the meter, and its damage scales as the fight progresses. This creates a natural, escalating power curve within a single encounter.
