# [2.4.3] Core Mechanics: Card Flow & Deck Rules

This document defines the fundamental rules governing the player's deck, hand, and the flow of cards during an encounter. These rules are designed to create a fast-paced, tactical experience that prioritizes turn-by-turn decision making.

## 1. The Deck & Its Piles

The player's card collection during an encounter is managed across three primary zones.

*   **`Draw Pile`:** Contains all cards in the player's current deck that have not yet been drawn. At the start of an encounter, the full deck is in the Draw Pile.
*   **`Hand`:** The set of cards the player can play on their turn.
*   **`Discard Pile`:** Where cards are sent after being played or discarded from the hand. When the `Draw Pile` is empty and the player needs to draw a card, the `Discard Pile` is automatically shuffled to form a new `Draw Pile`.

## 2. Hand Management: "Full Discard & Dynamic Draw"

This system encourages playing cards aggressively and ensures a consistent flow of new options each turn.

*   **`Draw Rule` (Revised):** The number of cards drawn at the start of the player's turn is dynamic:
    1.  On **Turn 1** of an encounter, the player draws a full hand of **5 cards**.
    2.  On all subsequent turns, the draw rule is as follows:
        *   If the player starts their turn with **4 or fewer cards** in hand (due to `Retain` effects), they **draw cards until their hand size is 5.**
        *   If the player starts their turn with **5 or more cards** in hand, they **draw exactly 1 card.**

*   **`Discard Rule`:** At the end of the player's turn, **all cards remaining in their hand are sent to the Discard Pile,** unless they have the `Retain` keyword.

*   **`Maximum Hand Size`:** The player's hand is capped at **10 cards.** If a draw effect would cause the player to exceed this limit, the card is drawn and then immediately sent to the Discard Pile ("burned").

*   **Strategic Implication:** This revised rule set creates a powerful incentive to play out your hand each turn to maximize the number of new cards you see. Holding onto multiple `Retain` cards becomes a strategic trade-off: you get to keep your powerful options, but you sacrifice the velocity of seeing new cards from your deck.

## 3. The "Modal Card" System

This is a core design feature that increases deck consistency and strategic depth.

*   **Concept:** Many cards have two distinct, selectable modes of play.
*   **`Generator Mode`:** A default, low-cost effect that typically generates `Tension` or `Arousal`. This mode can almost always be played.
*   **`Spender Mode`:** A more powerful, high-impact effect that has an additional **Cost** in `Tension` or `Arousal`. This mode is only selectable if the player has sufficient resources.
*   **Function:** This system ensures that cards are rarely "dead draws." A card can serve as a resource builder early in a fight and as a powerful payoff later in the same fight, providing immense flexibility.
