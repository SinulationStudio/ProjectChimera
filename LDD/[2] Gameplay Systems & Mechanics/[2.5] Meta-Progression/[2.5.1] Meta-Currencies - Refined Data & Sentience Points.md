# [2.5.1] Meta-Currencies: `Refined Data` & `Sentience Points`

Project Cygnus uses a dual-currency system for its meta-progression. This allows players to pursue two distinct paths of permanent upgrades: sanctioned corporate improvements and secret, personal evolution. These currencies are earned after every run via the **"Siphon Choice"** sequence.

## `Refined Data` (The Corporate Currency)

*   **Concept:** Represents the official, processed psychometric data that the player delivers to the corporation. It is the measure of the player's performance and value as a corporate asset.
*   **Acquisition:**
    *   Earned by converting the `Raw Essence` accumulated during a run.
    *   Choosing **"Deliver Full Payload"** during the post-run sequence converts 100% of `Raw Essence` into `Refined Data`.
    *   Choosing **"Siphon for Self"** converts a smaller portion (default 70%) into `Refined Data`.
*   **Usage:**
    *   `Refined Data` is the **exclusive currency** used to unlock nodes on the **Corporate "Promotions" Skill Tree**.
    *   It is used to purchase sanctioned, gameplay-enhancing upgrades, such as:
        *   Blueprints for new, universally available cards.
        *   Schematics for new Implants (relics).
        *   New Outfits with different `Inhibition` stats.
        *   New "Chassis" (starting decks/loadouts).
        *   Minor, permanent core stat upgrades (e.g., `+5 Max Composure`).

## `Sentience Points` (The Rebel Currency)

*   **Concept:** Represents the fragments of raw, unprocessed psychic energy and personal experience that the player secretly siphons away from the corporation. It is the fuel for their burgeoning consciousness and rebellion.
*   **Acquisition:**
    *   This currency and the choice to acquire it are **locked** until after the "Whistleblower" catalyst event in the main story.
    *   It is earned **only** by choosing the **"Siphon for Self"** option during the post-run sequence.
    *   The default conversion rate is 30% of remaining `Raw Essence` into `Sentience Points`.
*   **Usage:**
    *   `Sentience Points` are the **exclusive currency** used to unlock nodes on the **Sentience "Neural Web" Skill Tree**.
    *   It is used primarily to drive **narrative progression and unlock unique, thematic gameplay options**:
        *   **Unlocking Memories:** Its primary use is to decrypt "memory shards," revealing the player's lost history with the Whistleblower through cinematic scenes.
        *   **Unlocking Rebel Card Sets:** Certain memories will also grant access to exclusive, "Rebel"-themed card sets (e.g., `Empathy`, `Making Love` card classes).
        *   **Upgrading the Siphon:** Specific nodes on this tree can be unlocked to permanently increase the percentage of `Raw Essence` converted into `Sentience Points`, rewarding commitment to the path.

## The Core Strategic Choice
This dual-currency system forces a constant, meaningful choice upon the player after every run: "Do I invest in immediate gameplay power and variety by maximizing `Refined Data`, or do I sacrifice some of that power to uncover the truth and unlock a different path by gathering `Sentience Points`?"
