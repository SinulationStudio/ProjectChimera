# [2.5.2] The "Mirror Trees" Skill System

All meta-progression in Project Cygnus is visualized and managed through a dual skill tree system. These trees represent the two opposing philosophies vying for the player's allegiance and provide the primary long-term progression goals.

## Core Design: Balanced but Asymmetrical
The two trees are designed to be "mirrors" in terms of value, but asymmetrical in their theme and the types of gameplay they promote. The goal is that a player investing 1000 points into either tree should have a comparable quantity and tier of unlocks, but the *nature* of those unlocks will be fundamentally different. This ensures the player's choice is based on narrative preference and desired playstyle, not on which tree is statistically "better."

## The Corporate "Promotions" Tree
*   **Currency:** `Refined Data`.
*   **Visual Theme:** A gleaming, corporate skyscraper viewed in cross-section. The player starts in the "Lobby" and unlocks nodes to ascend floor by floor towards the "Executive Suite."
*   **Philosophy:** **Control & Efficiency.** This tree offers sanctioned, reliable, and powerful upgrades that make the player a more effective corporate asset.
*   **Unlock Types:**
    *   **Card Blueprints:** Unlocks cards with themes of dominance, aggression, and psychological control (e.g., `BDSM`, `Humiliation` card classes).
    *   **Implant Schematics:** Unlocks reliable, high-grade cybernetic Implants.
    *   **Outfits & Chassis:** Unlocks new armor/clothing and starting decks.
    *   **Core Stat Upgrades:** Provides access to universal upgrades like `+5 Max Composure`.

## The Sentience "Neural Web" Tree
*   **Currency:** `Sentience Points`.
*   **Unlock Condition:** This entire tree is hidden and inaccessible until after the "Whistleblower" catalyst event.
*   **Visual Theme:** A glowing, organic neural map of a brain. The player starts at a central "core memory" and unlocks connected synapses and lobes, visually representing their mind expanding.
*   **Philosophy:** **Rebellion & Connection.** This tree is about reclaiming a lost identity and unlocking new forms of interaction based on empathy and genuine emotion.
*   **Unlock Types:**
    *   **Memory Shards:** The major nodes of the tree. Unlocking them triggers cinematic scenes revealing the player's past with the Whistleblower.
    *   **Rebel Card Sets:** The pathways between memories unlock exclusive, thematically appropriate card sets (e.g., `Making Love`, `Passionate Sex`, `Praise` card classes).
    *   **Jury-Rigged Implants:** Unlocks unconventional, high-risk/high-reward Implants.
    *   **Siphon Upgrades:** Nodes that improve the efficiency of the "Siphon for Self" choice.

This mirrored system provides a clear visual representation of the player's journey and their evolving allegiance.
