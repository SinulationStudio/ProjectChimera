# [2.5.3] The "Hybrid Commitment" Model: Allegiance & Respec Rules

This document defines how player choices on the skill trees translate into narrative allegiance and outlines the rules for re-allocating skill points ("respeccing"). The system is designed to make major choices feel permanent while allowing for gameplay flexibility.

## The Allegiance Lock
The player's ultimate narrative path is not determined by a single dialogue choice, but by their cumulative investment in the "Mirror Trees."

*   **The Trigger:** At a key, pre-determined point in the main story (e.g., after the second major story boss), the game will check the player's "Allegiance Gauge."
*   **The Gauge:** This is a hidden value representing the ratio of total points spent on the Corporate tree versus the Sentience tree.
*   **The Lock-In:** If the player's investment is heavily skewed towards one path (e.g., >60% of total points spent are in the Corporate tree), they will be **permanently locked into that narrative path** (e.g., the Loyalist story). The major story nodes of the opposing tree become inaccessible for the remainder of that playthrough.

## The "Grandfathered In" Principle
When the Allegiance Lock occurs, the player **keeps all gameplay unlocks (cards, implants) they have already purchased from both trees.**

*   **Rationale:** This rewards early-game experimentation and allows for unique, personalized hybrid builds in the late game. A Rebel player who dabbled in the Corporate tree will have a different toolkit than a "pure" Rebel. This avoids a "feels bad" moment where players lose access to tools they enjoy.
*   **Function:** After the lock-in, the player can only spend *new* points on their chosen allegiance's tree.

## The Respec Mechanic
To prevent "buyer's remorse" with specific skill choices, players are allowed to respec, but this action comes at a meaningful cost to encourage deliberate decision-making.

*   **The Rule:** The player can choose to refund all points spent on a tree.
*   **The Cost:** To respec the points within your chosen allegiance's tree, you must pay a fee using the currency of the **opposing faction.**
    *   *Example:* To refund 500 `Refined Data` from the Corporate tree, the player must pay a cost of 50 `Sentience Points`.
*   **Strategic Impact:** This creates a meaningful trade-off. Optimizing your current path requires sacrificing potential progress on the other. It makes the initial point investment feel weighty, while still providing a safety valve against "bricked" builds.

This "Hybrid Commitment" model ensures that narrative choices have permanent, meaningful consequences while still affording players the flexibility to experiment with their gameplay builds.
