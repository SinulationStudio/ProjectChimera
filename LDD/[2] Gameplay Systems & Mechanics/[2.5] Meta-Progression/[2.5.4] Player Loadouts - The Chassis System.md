# [2.5.4] Player Loadouts - The Chassis System

The "Chassis" system provides significant, long-term replayability by allowing the player to fundamentally change their starting conditions for a run. Each Chassis represents a different base model or core personality programming for the player character, offering a distinct starting deck and playstyle.

## Core Concept
*   **Chassis as a "Class":** A Chassis is effectively a starting "class" or "archetype" that the player can choose before beginning a new run.
*   **Unlocking New Chassis:** New Chassis are major, high-tier rewards. They are typically unlocked by reaching the upper echelons of the Corporate and Sentience skill trees, or potentially as a reward for completing a major story arc. This makes them prestigious, long-term goals for the player to work towards.
*   **Independence from Skill Trees:** The chosen Chassis determines the **starting point** of a run. The pool of cards and implants available to find *during* the run is determined by what the player has unlocked on their skill trees. The two systems are separate but synergistic.

## Chassis Components
Each Chassis is defined by three core components:

**1. A Unique Starting Deck:**
*   This is the primary differentiator. Each Chassis comes with its own unique, 10-card starting deck built around a specific theme or strategy. This immediately changes the player's approach to the early game.

**2. Modified Starting Stats:**
*   A Chassis may alter the player's baseline stats, creating a risk/reward trade-off.
*   *Example:* A "Tank" Chassis might start with +15 `Max Composure` but have a lower starting `Inhibition` value. An "Aggressive" Chassis might start with a bonus to `Arousal` generation but have less `Max Composure`.

**3. A Unique Passive Ability:**
*   Each Chassis has a small, permanent passive ability that further reinforces its intended playstyle. This ability is active from the very beginning of the run.

## Example Chassis Designs (Conceptual)

### **Chassis 01: "Seducer" (Default)**
*   **Description:** The standard, balanced model. Versatile and adaptable to any strategy.
*   **Starting Deck:** "The Professional's Primer" (our established starting deck).
*   **Starting Stats:** Standard (100 Composure / 100 Inhibition).
*   **Passive Ability:** None. This is the baseline experience.

### **Chassis 02: "The Dominant" (Corporate Unlock)**
*   **Description:** An aggressive, controlling model designed for efficient subjugation.
*   **Starting Deck:** A deck focused on applying debuffs and using `Verbal` commands, with fewer defensive cards.
*   **Starting Stats:** Normal Composure, -10 Max Inhibition.
*   **Passive Ability:** "Intimidating Presence" - At the start of each encounter, the NPC gains 1 stack of `Vulnerable`.

### **Chassis 03: "The Lover" (Sentience Unlock)**
*   **Description:** An empathetic model focused on connection and building momentum slowly.
*   **Starting Deck:** A deck with more `Defensive` cards and cards that reward healing or protecting the NPC's `Composure`.
*   **Starting Stats:** +10 Max Composure, -10% `Composure` damage dealt by all cards.
*   **Passive Ability:** "Empathetic Bond" - Whenever you gain `Focus`, the NPC also gains 2 `Focus`. (This could be a downside or an upside, depending on the situation).

By providing these distinct starting loadouts, the Chassis system ensures that even after hundreds of hours, the player can start a new run that feels fundamentally different and presents new strategic challenges.
