# [2.1.2] Between Runs Meta-Progression - The Hub

The Hub, provisionally framed as a secure section of the Corporate HQ, is the persistent space the player returns to between each "Server Gauntlet" run. It is where all permanent progression, narrative development, and run preparation occurs.

## Core Functions

1.  **Meta-Progression Center:**
    *   The primary function of the Hub is to allow the player to spend their permanent currencies (`Refined Data`, `Sentience Points`).
    *   This is done via the **"Mirror Trees" Skill System,** where the player invests in either the Corporate or Sentience tree to unlock new cards, Implants, Outfits, and other permanent gameplay modifiers.

2.  **Narrative Hub:**
    *   The main story unfolds here through interactions with key characters like **Madam Elara** and, eventually, **the Whistleblower**.
    *   Dialogue and available interactions will change dynamically based on the "NPC Memory System," reflecting the player's run outcomes and allegiance choices.

3.  **Run Preparation Terminal:**
    *   Before starting a new gauntlet, the player will access an "Operations Board" or terminal.
    *   Here, they can select their **"Chassis"** (starting deck/loadout) and equipped **"Outfit"** (`Inhibition` value) from their unlocked collection.
    *   This is also where they will select the **"Act"** or difficulty tier for their next run.

## Potential for Exploration & Character Interaction (WIP)
While the Hub's primary functions are mechanical, there is strong potential for it to be a more explorable, "safe house" style area. This is a design direction to be considered.

*   **Social Hub Concept:** NPCs that the player has encountered in the VR simulation (specifically willing participants like Analyst Sarah, or perhaps freed individuals later in the Rebel storyline) could appear in the Hub.
*   **Developing Side-Stories:** The player could engage in conversations with these NPCs here, separate from the post-encounter dialogues. This would be the primary vector for developing the individual side-stories for each character, allowing the player to build relationships and learn more about the world outside of the high-stakes run environment.
*   This would further strengthen the narrative pillar of the game and provide a valuable pacing break between intense runs. The feasibility of this feature will depend on development scope.

## The "Failure as Progress" Loop
The Hub is the anchor for our core loop. Whether a run ends in victory or failure, the player always returns here. This return is not a "Game Over" screen but a narrative beat, triggering new dialogue and providing the crucial opportunity to spend earned meta-currency, ensuring the player is always moving forward.
