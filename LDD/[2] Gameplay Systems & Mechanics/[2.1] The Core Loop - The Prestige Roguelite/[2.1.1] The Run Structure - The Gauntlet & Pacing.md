# [2.1.1] The Run Structure - The Gauntlet & Pacing

This document outlines the high-level structure, pacing, and time budget of a single gameplay session ("run").

## Core Philosophy: "Prestige Roguelite"
Project Cygnus eschews the traditional high-quantity, low-impact encounter design. Instead, each run is a curated sequence of fewer, more cinematic, and narratively significant encounters, designed to create a complete and satisfying session lasting approximately **60-75 minutes.**

## The "Server Gauntlet" Structure
A single run is framed as an "Essence Hunter" infiltrating a secure VR Server Block. A full, standard run is a self-contained gauntlet with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

*   **Total Node Count:** A complete run consists of approximately **15-18 total nodes.**
    *   **~10-12 "Full" Encounters:** Cinematic encounters with named NPCs.
    *   **~5-6 "Quick" Events:** Faster nodes for shops, non-combat events, and storylets.
*   **Boss Encounter:** The run culminates in a single, major **Boss Fight** against a rival Essence Hunter.
*   **Difficulty Tiers ("Acts"):** The overall difficulty of the gauntlet is determined by its "Act" level, which is selected in the Hub. Act 1 is the baseline difficulty. Higher Acts (unlocked later) will feature tougher enemies and new challenges, serving as the game's primary long-term difficulty scaling system (similar to *Slay the Spire's* Ascensions).

## Pacing Model: The "Rival Checkpoint"
To create a satisfying power curve within a single run, each gauntlet is divided into two halves by a mandatory, high-stakes encounter.

1.  **Part 1: The Approach:** The player navigates the first half of the run using their basic toolkit, facing Tier 1 and early Tier 2 NPCs.
2.  **The Mid-Boss (Rival Encounter):** At a key milestone (e.g., the 8th encounter), the player faces a guaranteed "Rival Encounter," a significantly tougher fight.
3.  **The Power Spike:** The primary reward for defeating this mid-boss is the unlock of a **`Position:` card** for the remainder of the run. This is a critical strategic turning point.

## Detailed Time Budget Analysis
The following is a breakdown of the estimated time for a standard encounter and a full run, based on established animation and player decision timings.

### Encounter Time Budget (Target: ~5 Minutes)

| Component | Time (seconds) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intro Dialogue** | 30s | Skippable cinematic to set the scene. |
| **Player Turn 1** | ~20s | Includes extended time for initial hand/board state analysis. |
| **Player Turns (Subsequent)** | ~12s/turn | Average decision time for an established encounter state. |
| **NPC Turns** | ~7s/turn | Includes telegraph (1s) and standard action animation (6s). |
| **Card Animations (Player)** | 3s (Gen/Util) / 6s (Spender) | Average turn includes a mix of these. |
| **`Intensity` Breaks** | 10s (total) | 2 breakpoints per fight at 5s each (e.g., Close Quarters, Embrace). |
| **`Inhibition` Breaks** | ~15s (average) | Assumes an average of 3 total breaks (player/NPC) at 5s each. |
| **Outro & Post-Encounter Dialogue** | 30s | Skippable cinematic and storylet. |
| **Reward Screen** | 15s | Time for player to read and select a new card. |

*   **Estimated Total per Standard Encounter:** Based on a 6-7 turn average, the total time is approximately **4.5 - 5 minutes.**

### Full Run Time Calculation

| Component | Quantity | Avg. Time | Total Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Encounters** | 10 | ~4.5 min | 45 min |
| **Mid-Boss Encounter** | 1 | ~6 min | 6 min |
| **Quick Events / Shops** | 5 | 1 min | 5 min |
| **Final Boss Encounter** | 1 | ~10 min | 10 min |
| **Sanctuary Node** | 1 | 1 min | 1 min |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED RUN TIME** | **~18 Nodes** | | **~67 minutes** |

This detailed budget confirms that our "Prestige" model with fewer, longer encounters successfully lands within our target 60-75 minute run time.
