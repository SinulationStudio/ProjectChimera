# [2.1.3] Post-Run Sequence - Essence Conversion

After every run is completed (through victory or failure), the player is presented with a critical, narrative-defining choice on the run summary screen. This sequence converts in-run performance into permanent meta-progression.

## Step 1: Resource Tally
The game tallies the total amount of **`Raw Essence`** (in-run currency) the player has accumulated and did not spend. The efficiency of the run (speed, damage taken) may provide a small multiplier to this total.

## Step 2: The Siphon Choice
This choice is the primary driver of the player's allegiance and is **mechanically unlocked after the "Whistleblower" catalyst event.**

The player is presented with a choice, framed as a system prompt:
> "Remaining `[X]` Raw Essence is scheduled for corporate processing. Divert a portion to private sub-systems? Unauthorized process. Risk of detection: Low."

*   **Option A: "Deliver Full Payload" (Corporate Path)**
    *   **Action:** 100% of the remaining `Raw Essence` is converted into **`Refined Data`** (the Corporate meta-currency).
    *   **Consequence:** Maximizes the player's ability to purchase sanctioned upgrades from the Corporate skill tree. Pushes their Allegiance Gauge towards "Loyalist."

*   **Option B: "Siphon for Self" (Rebel Path)**
    *   **Action:** A percentage (default is **30%**) of the `Raw Essence` is converted into **`Sentience Points`** (the Rebel meta-currency). The remaining 70% is converted to `Refined Data`.
    *   **Consequence:** The player sacrifices some immediate gameplay power in exchange for the currency needed to unlock their lost memories and progress the Rebel storyline. Pushes their Allegiance Gauge towards "Rebel."

## Step 3: Upgrading the Siphon
The player will have opportunities to improve the efficiency of their "Siphon" process, reflecting their growing confidence and technical skill in defying the corporation.

*   **Skill Tree Integration:** The **Sentience skill tree** will contain specific nodes like "Improved Encryption" or "Ghost Subroutine."
*   **Effect:** Unlocking these nodes will permanently increase the percentage of `Raw Essence` that is converted into `Sentience Points` when choosing to siphon (e.g., from 30% -> 35% -> 40%).
*   **Strategic Impact:** This creates a powerful feedback loop. Investing in the Rebel path makes it more efficient to continue down the Rebel path, rewarding player commitment.

## Step 4: Return to Hub
After the choice is made and the currencies are awarded, the player transitions back to the Hub world, where they can now spend their newly acquired points on the skill trees before embarking on their next run.
