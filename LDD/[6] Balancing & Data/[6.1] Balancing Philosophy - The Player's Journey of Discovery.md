# [6.1] Balancing Philosophy - The Player's Journey of Discovery

This document outlines the core philosophy that will guide all mechanical and numerical balancing for Project Cygnus. Our approach is centered on creating a rewarding experience that respects the player's intelligence and encourages strategic self-discovery.

## Core Tenet: "Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master"
The game's surface-level mechanics should be simple and intuitive. The complexity should emerge from the interaction between systems. A new player should be able to understand their basic tools, but a veteran player should still be discovering new synergies and strategies after dozens of hours.

## The Player's Learning Curve
Our balancing will be designed to facilitate a specific, three-stage learning journey for the player:

1.  **Stage 1: Surface-Level Understanding.** The player first learns the most obvious truths.
    *   *Example:* They see that `Physical` cards have higher damage numbers than `Verbal` cards and naturally conclude that a physical-focused strategy is "strongest." Our early-game balance will allow this strategy to be effective against weak opponents, validating the player's initial conclusion.

2.  **Stage 2: Encountering the "Wall".** The player progresses and encounters a challenge designed to specifically counter their initial, simple strategy.
    *   *Example:* They face an NPC with extremely high `Guarded` values. Their powerful `Physical` cards suddenly feel ineffective, dealing heavily reduced damage. This forces them to question their strategy and re-evaluate their tools.

3.  **Stage 3: The "Aha!" Moment & Deeper Understanding.** The player experiments and discovers the hidden strength of previously undervalued mechanics.
    *   *Example:* They realize that `Verbal` cards, despite their lower base damage, bypass the `Guarded` defense entirely. They learn that the "weaker" cards are actually the key to unlocking their more powerful ones. This moment of self-discovery, achieved without explicit tutorials, is the core reward of our design.

## Key Balancing Principles

*   **Offense Over Defense:** Playing offensively should generally be more AP-efficient than playing defensively. This encourages proactive play and keeps the pace of encounters engaging. Defensive cards are tactical necessities, not a default strategy.
*   **No "Trap" Choices:** While some cards or strategies will be more situational than others, we will avoid creating "trap" unlocks or cards that are statistically always a bad choice. Every tool should have a viable niche or purpose.
*   **Synergy is the Goal:** The balance will focus on rewarding clever combinations of cards and systems. The true power should not come from a single overpowered card, but from making multiple, individually weaker cards work together to create an effect greater than the sum of their parts.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** All major balance changes will be informed by our "Dual-Profile" simulation framework and, eventually, by live player data. We will tune based on evidence, not just gut feeling.

This philosophy ensures that the difficulty in our game comes from the depth of its systems, not from unfair mechanics, and that the greatest reward is the player's own growing sense of mastery.
