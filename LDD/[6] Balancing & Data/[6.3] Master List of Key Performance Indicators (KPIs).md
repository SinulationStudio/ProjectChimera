# [6.3] Master List of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This document serves as the central repository for all metrics tracked during simulation and, eventually, live player data analysis. These KPIs are essential for data-driven balancing and for understanding the player experience on a granular level.

## 1. Top-Level Run & Encounter Metrics
*These KPIs measure the overall outcome and pacing.*

*   **`Player Win Rate`:** The percentage of encounters that end in victory. Our single most important measure of overall difficulty.
*   **`Average Turns to Win/Lose`:** Measures the length of encounters. Helps tune game pacing and ensure fights don't drag on.

## 2. Player Survivability Metrics
*These KPIs measure player performance within a single encounter.*

*   **`Avg. Total Damage Taken (Player)`:** A single value combining all damage assigned to `Focus`, `Inhibition`, and `Composure`. A clear indicator of encounter difficulty.
*   **`Avg. Damage Mitigated by Focus (Player)`:** Measures the effectiveness and usage frequency of `Defensive` cards.
*   **`"Flawless Inhibition" Win Rate`:** The percentage of wins where the player's `Inhibition` bar was not broken. A key measure of player mastery.
*   **`"Comeback" Rate`:** The percentage of wins where the player's `Composure` dropped below a critical threshold (e.g., 25%) but they still won. Measures if the game feels "winnable from behind."

## 3. NPC Threat Metrics
*These KPIs measure NPC effectiveness and pressure.*

*   **`Avg. Damage Mitigated by Focus (NPC)`:** Measures how effective an NPC's defensive abilities are.
*   **`NPC Ultimate Usage Rate`:** The percentage of encounters where an NPC successfully forces the player into the `Exposed` state and uses their unlocked ultimate ability at least once. This is a direct measure of an NPC's threat level.

## 4. Economic & Resource Metrics
*These KPIs track the flow and usage of our unique `Tension` & `Arousal` systems.*

*   **`Time to First Spender`:** The average turn a player first plays a card that costs `Tension` or `Arousal`. Measures the pacing of the "ramp-up" phase.
*   **`Peak Resource Values`:** The average maximum `Tension` and `Arousal` a player accumulates. Helps balance the costs of our most expensive cards.
*   **`Resource Waste Analysis`:** The average amount of unspent resources at the end of an encounter. High values may indicate a lack of effective "Spender" cards in the player's current deck.

## 5. Card & Strategy Choice Metrics
*These KPIs help us understand player behavior and balance the card pool.*

*   **`First Turn Play`:** The most frequently played card on Turn 1. Indicates perceived opening strength.
*   **`Card Reward Selection Rate`:** The pick rate of cards from post-encounter rewards. The single best metric for identifying over- and under-powered cards.
*   **`Skip Reward Frequency`:** Measures how often players decline a card reward. Indicates the overall quality of card offerings.
*   **`Verbal vs. Physical Play Ratio`:** Tracks the percentage of `Verbal` vs. `Physical` cards played. Helps analyze the viability of different strategic paths.
*   **`Modal Card Choice Ratio`:** For modal cards, tracks the percentage of time the "Generator" vs. "Spender" mode is chosen. Helps balance the two halves of a card.
*   **`Card Usage Rate`:** The frequency a card is played when drawn. Low rates can indicate a card is too niche, too expensive, or underpowered.
