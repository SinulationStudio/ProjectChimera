# [6.2] The Dual-Profile Simulation Framework

To ensure a balanced and satisfying difficulty curve, all major mechanical designs and tuning changes will be tested using a robust internal simulation framework. This data-driven approach allows for rapid iteration and balancing based on predictable player archetypes.

The framework is built on two distinct AI "player" profiles, designed to test the game's difficulty floor and skill ceiling.

## Simulation Profiles

### **Profile A: "The Tactician" (Average Player Model)**
*   **Concept:** This model represents a player who understands the game's basic rules but does not always play with perfect, long-term optimization. Their play is more reactive than proactive.
*   **Heuristics:**
    *   **Primary Goal:** Address immediate threats. Will use defensive cards if a telegraphed attack is significant.
    *   **Resource Use:** Will prioritize playing high-impact "Spender" cards as soon as they have the resources, without necessarily saving for a more optimal turn.
    *   **Offense:** Will tend to use the highest damage-per-AP card available in hand without always considering the long-term strategic benefit of targeting a specific `Guarded` weakness.
*   **Purpose:** This profile serves as our **difficulty floor baseline.** If the Tactician is winning too easily or losing too often (especially in the early game), it indicates a fundamental balance issue for the average player experience. The game must be winnable and feel fair for this profile.

### **Profile B: "The Virtuoso" (Proficient Player Model)**
*   **Concept:** This model represents a skilled, experienced player who understands the game's deeper mechanics, plans ahead, and aims for efficient, optimal play.
*   **Heuristics:**
    *   **Primary Goal:** Solve the encounter's puzzle efficiently. Actively plays around telegraphed NPC actions.
    *   **Resource Use:** Will strategically hold resources for a multi-card combo turn if it provides a greater advantage than spending immediately.
    *   **Offense:** Understands and prioritizes targeting the most vulnerable defensive layer (e.g., using `Verbal` cards against `Inhibition`).
    *   **Synergy:** Recognizes and exploits card synergies (e.g., using a debuff before a major attack).
*   **Purpose:** This profile serves as our **skill ceiling baseline.** A high win rate for the Virtuoso indicates that mastery is possible and rewarding. The performance gap between the Tactician and the Virtuoso is a direct measure of the game's strategic depth and skill expression.

## Simulation Parameters
*   **Batch Size:** All standard simulations will be run in batches of **100 runs per profile** to ensure a statistically relevant sample size. This may be increased for more complex, late-game encounters.
*   **Logic Adherence:** All simulations must strictly adhere to the established game rules (e.g., the "Shield -> Armor -> Body" damage flow) to be considered valid.
*   **Data Logging:** The results of all simulations, including all tracked Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), will be logged for historical analysis and to inform all balance discussions.

This dual-profile framework allows us to balance the game for both casual and hardcore players, ensuring it is both accessible at the start and deep enough to sustain long-term engagement.
