# [1.4] Target Audience, Platform, & Funding Strategy

This document defines the intended player base for Project Cygnus, our strategy for distribution, and our approach to community-driven funding, including a realistic assessment of platform constraints.

---

## 1. Primary Target Audience

Our ideal player fits into the intersection of several key demographics:

*   **Core Identity:** **Players of deep, strategic roguelike deck-builders.** These are individuals who appreciate the core gameplay loop of *Slay the Spire*, *Monster Train*, or *Inscryption*.
*   **Secondary Identity:** **Fans of story-rich, character-driven RPGs and Visual Novels.** These players are drawn to games like *Hades*, *Cyberpunk 2077*, or the *Persona* series.
*   **NSFW Content Preference:** The player is explicitly seeking a high-quality, **explicitly adult (R-18) gaming experience** and is comfortable with direct, uncensored depictions of nudity and consensual sexual acts.

**Psychographic Profile:** Ages 21-45, enjoys complex single-player experiences, and appreciates games that trust their intelligence both mechanically and narratively.

## 2. Platform & Funding Strategy

Our strategy is a dual-platform approach designed to build a dedicated community, fund development, and achieve commercial success while adhering to platform policies.

### **2.1 Primary Development & Community Platform: Patreon**

Patreon will serve as the financial and community backbone during the game's development.

*   **The Model:** We will release monthly or bi-monthly early access builds of the game exclusively to patrons. Tiers will offer varying levels of access and rewards (e.g., alpha/beta builds, behind-the-scenes updates, polls to influence design).
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Stable Income:** Provides a predictable monthly income stream, which is invaluable for a solo developer and mitigates the risk of a single launch day.
    *   **Community Building:** Cultivates a dedicated, passionate community that can provide high-quality feedback throughout development.
    *   **Lower Commission:** Patreon's commission (5-12%) is significantly lower than Steam's.
*   **NSFW Policy:** Patreon is a well-established and permissive platform for adult game developers, making it a safe home for our project's content.

### **2.2 Primary Commercial Platform: Steam**

The full "Version 1.0" of the game will be released on the Steam storefront for PC.

*   **Reach:** Steam offers access to the largest digital distribution market for PC games, providing the greatest potential for commercial success.
*   **NSFW Policy:** We will leverage Steam's "Adults Only" category, ensuring we provide a thorough and honest content disclosure during the submission process to release the game uncensored.

### **2.3 Navigating the Dual-Platform Strategy**

Successfully launching a Patreon-funded game on Steam requires adherence to the specific rules of both platforms.

#### **Steam's Policies to Respect:**

1.  **External Linking:** Direct links to fundraising platforms like Patreon are generally forbidden on the main store page description. We will use the dedicated website/social media fields to link to our own project website, which can then link to Patreon. We may cautiously mention the Patreon in our Steam Community Hub and forums.
2.  **Pricing Parity & Steam Keys:** We must not sell our game for a lower price on other platforms than on Steam. When providing Steam keys to patrons as a reward, this will be handled carefully. A common best practice is to offer keys to patrons who have pledged a cumulative amount equivalent to or greater than the game's retail price on Steam.
3.  **Key Redemption Ratio:** Steam monitors key redemptions versus direct sales. An excessively high ratio of giveaways can lead to Valve restricting the issuance of new keys. Our strategy will aim for a healthy balance.

#### **Patreon's Policies to Respect:**

1.  **No Exclusivity:** Patreon does not restrict developers from releasing their work on other platforms.
2.  **Transparency:** Our primary responsibility is to be transparent with our patrons about our development roadmap, including our plans for the V1.0 Steam release, and to reliably deliver the rewards promised in our tiers.

#### **Our Combined Strategy:**

*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Patreon will be for early access, direct developer interaction, and exclusive behind-the-scenes content. Steam will be for the polished, stable, complete V1.0 product.
*   **Roadmap Transparency:** Our Patreon page and other community hubs will feature a clear roadmap outlining the development phases leading up to the Steam release.
*   **Careful Promotion:** We will drive traffic to our Patreon primarily through our own social media channels and project website, not directly from the Steam store page.

### **2.4 Prohibited Platforms: Mainstream Consoles & Mobile**
(This section remains unchanged, confirming that these platforms are not viable due to their strict anti-NSFW policies.)

### **2.5 Engine Renderer Choice Rationale**
Our decision to use the **`Compatibility`** renderer in Godot is strongly reinforced by this platform strategy. Our target is a wide PC audience via Steam and a dedicated community via Patreon. The `Compatibility` renderer ensures maximum reach and performance on the only platforms that matter to our project.
