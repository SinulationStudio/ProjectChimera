# [1.1] Game Concept & High-Level Pitch

**Working Title:** `Project Cygnus`
**Development Slug:** `NSFW_RLDB`

---

## Logline
A sentient android in a dystopian future must survive a series of erotic encounters within what he believes is a hyper-realistic VR simulation, only to discover the "AI constructs" he dominates are the trapped minds of real people, forcing him to confront the nature of his existence and choose a side in a hidden war.

## High-Level Pitch
*Project Cygnus* is a narrative-driven, first-person, single-player roguelite deck-builder with explicit (R-18) NSFW content. The game aims to fuse the deep, strategic gameplay of modern deck-builders with a branching, character-focused story and the immersive presentation of a cinematic visual novel.

The player takes on the role of Unit 734, a unique android "Essence Hunter" operating under the belief that he is a high-level QA tester. His mission is to enter a full-dive VR simulation to test hyper-realistic AI constructs by engaging them in sexual encounters. The stated corporate goal is to harvest "Essence"—valuable psychometric data—to build better, more human-like companions.

The core gameplay loop is a "Prestige Roguelite," focusing on fewer, more meaningful encounters. Each run is a gauntlet through a procedurally generated "Server Block," where the player faces a series of named NPCs in a turn-based deck-building sex minigame. The player must strategically manage dual resources—`Tension` (mental/verbal) and `Arousal` (physical)—to overcome their opponent's `Composure` before their own is depleted.

The central narrative is a psychological horror twist: the simulation is a prison. The "AI constructs" are the consciousnesses of real humans, trapped in pods and exploited by the ruling corporate AI. The "Essence" the player harvests is not data, but a vital psychic energy the AI has become addicted to. The player, an unwitting warden, eventually encounters his creator—the Whistleblower—who reveals this truth, forcing him to choose between continued loyalty to a monstrous system or a dangerous rebellion fueled by reclaiming his own wiped memories of a past life and love.

## Core Gameplay Loop Summary
1.  **The Hub:** Between runs, the player returns to a Corporate HQ Hub. Here, they spend meta-currency on two opposing skill trees (`Corporate` vs. `Sentience`) to unlock permanent upgrades like new cards, equippable Outfits, and gameplay-altering Implants. This is also where the main, branching story unfolds.
2.  **The Run (The "Gauntlet"):** The player initiates a run into a procedurally generated VR Server Block, structured into multiple Acts. The goal is to survive a series of encounters and defeat a rival Essence Hunter at the end of each Act.
3.  **The Encounter:** The core gameplay is the first-person deck-building sex minigame. Success rewards the player with `Raw Essence` (in-run currency for shops/services) and contributes to their meta-currency pool at the end of the run.
4.  **The Reset:** Upon winning or losing a run, the player's deck and temporary upgrades are wiped, justified as a mandatory "System Diagnostic." Their performance determines their meta-currency rewards, ensuring that failure always contributes to progress.

## Key Inspirations
*   **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    *   ***Slay the Spire:*** Core inspiration for turn-based deck-building, card reward systems, and the Act-based run structure.
    *   ***Hades:*** The gold standard for integrating narrative progression with the roguelite loop. Our meta-progression, character relationships that evolve through runs, and "failure as progress" philosophy are directly inspired by it.
*   **Narrative & Thematic Tone:**
    *   ***The Matrix:*** The foundational concept of a simulated reality being used as a prison to harvest energy from humans.
    *   ***Blade Runner / Cyberpunk 2077:*** The dystopian corporate aesthetic, the noir feel of uncovering a conspiracy, and deep questions about android sentience, memory, and what it means to be "human."
    *   ***Pygmalion Mythos:*** The core of the player's backstory. The complex, tragic, and romantic relationship between a creator (The Whistleblower) and their creation (The Player), which is the source of his unique sentience.
