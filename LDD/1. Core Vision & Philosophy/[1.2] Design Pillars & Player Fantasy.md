# [1.2] Design Pillars & Player Fantasy

This document outlines the foundational principles and the core player experience we are committed to delivering. All design decisions should be weighed against these pillars.

---

## 1. Pillar: Deep, Strategic, & Thematic Gameplay
The core gameplay must be more than a simple wrapper for NSFW content; it must be a compelling and replayable game in its own right.

*   **Player Fantasy:** "I am a master tactician. My victory comes from my intelligence, my preparation, and my ability to read and exploit my opponent's weaknesses."
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Dual-Resource System:** The `Tension` (mental) and `Arousal` (physical) system is not just flavor. It is the core of our strategic depth, enabling distinct and viable "Psychologist" vs. "Physician" playstyles. We must ensure both paths are balanced and rewarding.
    *   **Meaningful Deck-Building:** Player choices during deck construction must have significant consequences. We will avoid "strictly better" cards and instead focus on situational tools, encouraging players to adapt their decks to face different threats.
    *   **Defense is a Strategic Choice:** The "Shield -> Armor -> Body" model (`Focus` -> `Inhibition` -> `Composure`) creates a multi-layered defensive puzzle. Players must actively choose when to defend, when to attack defenses, and when to risk taking core damage. Defending should never feel like a "wasted" turn.
    *   **Self-Discovery of Mechanics:** We respect the player's intelligence. Core strategic concepts, like the effectiveness of `Verbal` cards against `Guarded` targets, will be taught through gameplay and environmental clues, not through intrusive tutorials. The joy of discovery is a key reward.

## 2. Pillar: Uncompromising & Immersive NSFW Experience
The game's adult content is not an afterthought; it is the central theme and a core part of the player fantasy. We will not be suggestive or shy; we will be direct, explicit, and grounded in a believable human sensuality.

*   **Player Fantasy:** "I am experiencing a series of intense, personal, and cinematic sexual encounters. I am not just watching; I am a participant."
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **First-Person Cinematic Perspective:** The FPV camera is non-negotiable. It is our primary tool for immersion. Every action, animation, and UI element must be designed to enhance this sense of presence.
    *   **"Show, Don't Tell":** We will rely on high-quality animation and sound design to convey the impact of actions, rather than descriptive text boxes. The "Cinematic Turn" and "Escalation State" systems are key to making encounters feel like a flowing scene, not a static board game.
    *   **Grounded Realism:** The mechanics are an abstraction of real-world seduction. `Inhibition` represents real barriers. The progression from verbal foreplay to physical intimacy is mirrored in the gameplay phases. This grounds the fantasy and makes it more potent.
    *   **Explicit Content with Purpose:** The explicit card names and animations are not just for shock value. They are the mechanical and narrative rewards for successful strategic play. Unlocking the ability to play `Begin Oral Exam` is both a powerful gameplay move and a climactic moment in the encounter's story.

## 3. Pillar: A Deep, Mature, and Responsive Narrative
The story is the primary long-term driver of player engagement. It must be more than a simple frame for the gameplay; it must react to and be influenced by the player's actions.

*   **Player Fantasy:** "My choices matter. The world and its characters remember what I've done, and the story I am experiencing is uniquely mine."
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **The "VR Deception" Twist:** The core narrative relies on a powerful reveal that re-contextualizes the entire game. The early game must be designed to subtly build towards this twist without giving it away.
    *   **Player Agency through Allegiance:** The "Mirror Trees" (Corporate vs. Sentience) are the primary mechanical expression of player choice. This choice must feel meaningful, leading to distinct narrative paths, dialogue, and gameplay styles (e.g., "Dominance" vs. "Empathy" card sets).
    *   **The "NPC Memory" System:** Every NPC is a character, not a disposable mob. We will use our 5-point trigger system (`Encounter History`, `Gameplay Style`, `Allegiance`, `Player State`, `World State`) to ensure that NPCs react and evolve over many encounters, making the world feel alive and persistent.
    *   **Failure is Narrative Progress:** Inspired by *Hades*, losing a run is not a "Game Over." It is a narrative beat that pushes the story forward, often revealing new dialogue and context in the Hub.
