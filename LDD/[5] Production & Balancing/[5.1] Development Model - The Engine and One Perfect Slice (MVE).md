# [5.1] Development Model: The Engine and One Perfect Slice (MVE)

This document outlines the production strategy for bringing Project Cygnus from concept to its initial public release. As a solo developer project with significant ambition, a phased, strategic approach is essential to ensure a successful and manageable development cycle.

## Core Philosophy: Build Vertically, Not Horizontally
We will not attempt to build the entire game with all its branching paths and content for the Version 1.0 release. This would lead to a shallow experience and an unsustainable workload. Instead, our strategy is to build a "vertical slice" that is deep, polished, and perfectly representative of the final game's quality.

Our Minimum Viable Experience (MVE) is defined as **"The Engine and One Perfect Slice."**

## The Engine: Building a Robust Foundation
The first phase of development is dedicated to creating all the core, reusable systems that will power the entire game. This includes:
*   The complete card combat system (`Composure`, `Inhibition`, `Focus`, `Tension`/`Arousal`).
*   The meta-progression framework (Hub, Skill Trees, Currencies).
*   The "NPC Memory" dialogue system and its triggers.
*   The GenAI asset pipeline and core animation systems (FPV, Cinematic Turns).
*   A functional starting deck and a small pool of additional cards, Implants, and Tier 1 NPCs.

## The One Perfect Slice: Curated V1.0 Content
Once the core engine is stable, we will focus on creating a single, complete, and polished narrative experience for the initial release.

### **V1.0 Content Plan:**

1.  **The Tutorial:** The hand-crafted "Diagnostic Cycle" featuring Analyst Sarah. This ensures all players have a smooth onboarding experience.

2.  **A Complete, Replayable Core Loop:**
    *   **The "Standard Gauntlet":** A full, procedurally generated run consisting of ~15-18 nodes (encounters, events, shops). This run will be our "Act 1" difficulty tier, culminating in a challenging Tier 1 Rival EH boss. This mode provides the core, endlessly replayable roguelite experience.
    *   **Narrative Integration:** The main story arc, from the start of the game through the "Whistleblower" catalyst event, will be woven into these standard runs. Key story moments will be triggered by the player reaching certain milestones (e.g., completing a run for the first time, defeating a boss 3 times).

3.  **A Satisfying Narrative Checkpoint (for V1.0):**
    *   The V1.0 story will conclude at a major, satisfying turning point: the **Allegiance Lock**. The player will have experienced the core truth and be forced to make their first major commitment to either the Corporate or Rebel path.
    *   This provides a complete narrative arc (from ignorance to revelation to choice) while clearly setting the stage for future story content.

This "vertical slice" approach ensures that our initial release is not a buggy, incomplete demo, but a polished and complete game experience that serves as a strong foundation for future content.
