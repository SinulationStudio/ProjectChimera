# [5.2] Funding & Community Model - Patreon & Steam

This document outlines the dual-platform strategy for funding development and releasing the game commercially, designed to maximize community engagement and financial stability.

## Strategy Overview
Our approach is to use Patreon as the primary platform for **community-driven development funding** and Steam as the primary platform for the **commercial V1.0 release**. This is a proven, synergistic model for independent NSFW game developers.

## Primary Development Platform: Patreon
Patreon is the financial and community backbone during the game's development.

*   **The Model:** We will release monthly or bi-monthly early access builds of the game exclusively to patrons. Tiers will offer varying levels of access and rewards (e.g., alpha/beta builds, behind-the-scenes content, design polls).
*   **Benefits:**
    1.  **Stable Income:** Provides a predictable monthly income, invaluable for a solo developer.
    2.  **Community Building:** Cultivates a dedicated community that provides high-quality feedback.
    3.  **Lower Commission:** Patreon's commission (5-12%) is lower than Steam's.
*   **NSFW Policy:** Patreon's policies are permissive of the explicit content in our game.

## Primary Commercial Platform: Steam
The full "Version 1.0" of the game will be released on the Steam storefront for PC.

*   **Reach:** Steam provides access to the largest digital distribution market for PC games.
*   **NSFW Policy:** We will utilize Steam's "Adults Only" category, providing a thorough content disclosure to release uncensored.

## Navigating the Dual-Platform Relationship
Success requires respecting the rules of both platforms.

#### **Steam Policy Considerations:**
*   **External Linking:** Direct links to Patreon on the main store page are forbidden. We will link to our project website, which will then link to Patreon.
*   **Steam Keys for Patrons:** This is allowed but must be handled carefully. To maintain pricing parity, keys will be offered to patrons who have pledged a cumulative amount equivalent to the game's retail price. We will monitor our key redemption ratio to stay in good standing with Valve.

#### **Patreon Policy Considerations:**
*   **No Exclusivity:** Patreon allows us to release on other platforms.
*   **Transparency:** We must be clear with patrons about the development roadmap and deliver on promised rewards.

### **Value Proposition for Each Platform**
*   **Patreon:** Offers exclusive early access to development builds, direct interaction with the developer, and a chance to influence the game.
*   **Steam:** Offers the final, polished, stable, and complete V1.0 product for a one-time purchase.
