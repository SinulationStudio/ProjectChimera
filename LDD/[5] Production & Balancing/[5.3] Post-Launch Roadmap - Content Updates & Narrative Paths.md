# [5.3] Post-Launch Roadmap - Content Updates & Narrative Paths

Project Cygnus is designed as an expandable experience. The V1.0 release is a complete, satisfying game that ends at a major narrative checkpoint (the Allegiance Lock). Post-launch development will focus on adding replayability and building out the branching storylines.

## Pillar 1: The "Mastery & Escalation" System
This system provides endgame content for dedicated players.

*   **The "Threat Level" System:** Post-launch, we will introduce escalating "Threat Levels" (similar to *Hades'* Heat). Each level adds new difficulties (e.g., tougher enemies, negative run modifiers) but also unlocks higher-tier rewards, creating a deep endgame grind.
*   **Bounties & Achievements:** We will add a "Bounty" system for specific, difficult in-game challenges (e.g., "Complete a run without taking `Composure` damage"). Rewards will include exclusive cosmetic Outfits or other prestige items.

## Pillar 2: Narrative & Content Expansion
The primary goal of post-launch development will be to complete the narrative paths established in V1.0.

*   **The "Loyalist Path" Expansion (Update 2.0):**
    *   The first major content update will be a full expansion of the Corporate Loyalist storyline.
    *   This will add a unique set of late-game encounters, a new final boss (a confrontation with the Whistleblower), and a fully realized narrative conclusion for this allegiance.

*   **The "Anarchist Path" Expansion (Update 3.0):**
    *   A potential second major update could add the secret third "Anarchist" ending, with its own unique goals and challenges for players who have mastered both main paths.

*   **Intermittent Content Drops:**
    *   Smaller, regular updates can add new content for all players, such as new unlockable "Chassis" (starting decks), new NPCs to encounter in the gauntlets, and new card packs for the skill trees, keeping the game fresh over time.

This roadmap ensures long-term player engagement and allows the full, branching story to be told in manageable development phases.
