# [2.1] The Core Loop: The "Prestige Roguelite" Model

Project Cygnus eschews the traditional high-quantity, low-impact encounter design of many roguelites. Instead, it adopts a "Prestige" model, focusing on fewer, more cinematic, and narratively significant encounters to create a complete, satisfying experience within a single run.

## Guiding Principles
*   **Quality over Quantity:** Every combat encounter is with a named, unique NPC and is treated as a high-effort, story-relevant set piece.
*   **Cinematic Pacing:** The time budget for encounters is designed to be substantial (~5 minutes), accommodating detailed animations and dialogue to enhance immersion.
*   **Failure as Progress:** Losing a run is a narrative mechanic that pushes the story forward and allows for meta-progression in the Hub.

## The Run Structure: The "Server Gauntlet"
A single "run" is an infiltration into a secure VR Server Block. The goal is a ~60-75 minute session with a clear difficulty curve and a climactic finish. The exact structure of the run's progression is under design, with the following model being the leading proposal.

### **Proposed Model: The "Rival Checkpoint" Structure**

This model divides a single run into two distinct "halves," creating a natural power-spike and escalation of stakes.

*   **Total Node Count:** A run would consist of approximately **15-18 total nodes**, including encounters, events, and a final boss.

*   **Part 1: The Approach**
    *   **Goal:** The player navigates the first half of the run using their starting deck and cards acquired from early encounters.
    *   **Content:** Features "Tier 1" and early "Tier 2" NPCs.
    *   **The Checkpoint:** A guaranteed, non-random **"Rival Encounter"** occurs at a key milestone in the run.

*   **The Rival Encounter (Mid-Boss)**
    *   **Concept:** This is a significantly tougher fight than the preceding ones. It could be against a "Tier 2 Elite" version of a standard NPC (with enhanced stats and new abilities) or a unique, named mini-boss character.
    *   **Primary Reward:** Upon defeating this Rival, the player unlocks their **"Position"** card capability for the remainder of the run. They would be offered a choice of one of three unlocked "Positional Blueprints" to install, which adds the corresponding `Position:` card to their deck.

*   **Part 2: The Deep Run**
    *   **Goal:** The player now proceeds through the second half of the run, armed with their powerful new `Position:` card.
    *   **Content:** Features the most difficult "Tier 2" and "Tier 3" NPCs. The player is expected to build their strategy around deploying their ultimate move.
    *   **Final Nodes:** The run culminates with a **Sanctuary (Rest Site)** followed by the final **Act Boss** (a top-tier Rival EH).

**Rationale for this Model:**
*   It creates a clear and satisfying power curve within a single run.
*   It gates the most complex mechanic (`Position:` cards) until the player has a solid grasp of the fundamentals.
*   It provides a strong narrative beat in the middle of the run, breaking up the string of standard encounters.

### **Key Design Variable: Pacing the "Position" Unlock**

The exact timing of the "Rival Encounter" is a critical balancing lever that will be subject to significant playtesting and iteration.

*   **Early Unlock (e.g., after Encounter 4-5):** Gives the player more time to use and build around their `Position:` card, making them feel powerful sooner. This may require making the latter half of the run more difficult to compensate.
*   **Mid-Run Unlock (e.g., after Encounter 8-9):** Creates a very distinct "before and after" feel to the run, as proposed above. This is the current leading model.
*   **Late Unlock (e.g., as the Act 1 Boss):** A previous model where the Positional Stance was a reward for clearing the first of three acts. This is archived but could be revisited if a longer run structure is desired.

The final implementation will be determined by what creates the most satisfying difficulty curve and sense of progression for the player.

## In-Run Progression Interface (To Be Finalized)
The method for navigating between nodes is a key design decision still under consideration.
*   **Option A (Standard Model):** A traditional, abstract, branching node map similar to *Slay the Spire*. This is mechanically clear and familiar to players.
*   **Option B (Archived - Diegetic Menu):** A "Clue-like" menu of actions within a persistent location. While highly immersive, this was archived due to concerns that a purely static version would lack roguelite variety. A version with randomized actions remains a possibility but requires further design.
