# [2.2.3] The Defensive System: Shield -> Armor -> Body

The survivability of both the player and NPCs during Sex Combat is governed by a three-tiered defensive system. Incoming `Composure` loss is always applied to these layers in a strict, sequential order, creating a deep and tactical defensive meta-game.

## Layer 1: `Focus` (The Shield)
*   **Concept:** Represents a character's immediate mental concentration and ability to parry or shrug off a seductive advance. It is a temporary, active defense.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Generated by playing cards with the **`Defensive`** keyword (e.g., `Steel Your Nerves`).
    *   `Focus` absorbs all incoming `Composure` loss until it is depleted.
    *   At the end of a character's turn, any remaining `Focus` is **halved (rounded down)**.
*   **Strategic Implications:** The degradation mechanic makes `Focus` a powerful tool for both full blocks and damage mitigation over multiple turns. A player can "stockpile" a large amount of `Focus` in a safe turn to prepare for telegraphed high damage, or to have a buffer before initiating a `Position` card that has a self-inflicted `Composure` cost.

## Layer 2: `Inhibition` (The Armor)
*   **Concept:** Represents a character's clothing, personal boundaries, and psychological barriers. It is a semi-persistent defensive layer that must be broken down over time.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Any `Composure` loss that gets past `Focus` is applied to the `Inhibition` bar.
    *   The main `Composure` bar cannot be damaged until `Inhibition` is fully depleted (with rare exceptions, see below).
    *   For the player, `Inhibition` is a run-persistent stat tied to their **Outfit**, providing a core strategic choice during run preparation.
*   **Strategic Implications:** `Inhibition` and the Outfit system serve as a primary **difficulty scaling and challenge-run mechanic.** We can design high-`Inhibition` outfits that offer great protection but perhaps a debuff, or low-`Inhibition` outfits for players seeking a challenge. This provides a thematic and immersive way to modify run difficulty. Forcing the player to complete a run with a specific, challenging outfit could be a unique bounty or achievement.

## Layer 3: `Composure` (The Body)
*   **Concept:** Represents a character's core stability and control over their own arousal. It is the character's fundamental "health."
*   **Thematic Effect:** Losing all `Composure` is not death; it is the moment a character loses all professional and mental detachment, culminating in an uncontrollable, climactic orgasm. This is the win/loss condition of the encounter.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   `Composure` is only damaged if an attack fully breaks through both `Focus` and `Inhibition`.
    *   **Inhibition-Ignoring Attacks:** Certain rare and powerful abilities may have a modifier that allows them to deal damage directly to `Composure`, bypassing a target's remaining `Inhibition`.
        *   *Example:* An NPC `Position: Lap Dance` ability could be designed to deal `X` damage to the player's `Inhibition` and `Y` damage directly to their `Composure` simultaneously, representing both a physical barrier break and a direct psychological assault. This makes such abilities extremely dangerous and high-priority threats.

This hierarchical system forces players to make constant decisions about which layer to protect, which to sacrifice, and how to manage both short-term threats and long-term attrition.
