# [2.2.3] The Defensive System: Shield -> Armor -> Body

The survivability of both the player and NPCs during Sex Combat is governed by a three-tiered defensive system. Incoming `Composure` loss is always applied to these layers in a strict, sequential order.

## Layer 1: `Focus` (The Shield)
*   **Concept:** Represents a character's immediate mental concentration and ability to parry or shrug off a seductive advance. It is a temporary, active defense.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Generated by playing cards with the **`Defensive`** keyword (e.g., `Steel Your Nerves`).
    *   `Focus` absorbs all incoming `Composure` loss until it is depleted.
    *   At the end of a character's turn, any remaining `Focus` is **halved (rounded down)**. This "degradation" allows for tactical carry-over without permitting infinite stacking, rewarding proactive defense.
*   **Strategic Role:** The primary tool for mitigating small, repeated attacks and for blocking telegraphed high-damage abilities without sacrificing the more permanent `Inhibition` layer.

## Layer 2: `Inhibition` (The Armor)
*   **Concept:** Represents a character's clothing, personal boundaries, and psychological barriers. It is a semi-persistent defensive layer that must be broken down over time.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Any `Composure` loss that gets past `Focus` is applied to the `Inhibition` bar.
    *   The main `Composure` bar cannot be damaged until `Inhibition` is fully depleted.
    *   For the player, `Inhibition` is a run-persistent stat tied to their **Outfit**. It regenerates to the top of the last broken threshold between encounters.
    *   For NPCs, `Inhibition` resets to full at the start of every encounter.

## Layer 3: `Composure` (The Body)
*   **Concept:** Represents a character's core stability and control over their own arousal. It is the character's fundamental "health."
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   `Composure` is only damaged if an attack fully breaks through both `Focus` and `Inhibition`.
    *   For the player, `Composure` is run-persistent. If it reaches 0, the run ends.
    *   For the NPC, `Composure` resets each encounter. If it reaches 0, the player wins the encounter.

This hierarchical system creates a deep defensive meta-game, forcing players to make constant decisions about which layer to protect and which to sacrifice.
