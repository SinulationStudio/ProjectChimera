# [2.3.1] Player Systems

This document details the core stats, resources, and unique mechanics governing the player character, defining their capabilities and limitations within a run.

## Core Stats & Resources

The following table outlines the player's primary resources and their properties.

| Resource         | Baseline Value    | Max Value (Upgradable)   | Persistence        | Description                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Composure**    | 100               | ~200                     | **Run-Persistent** | The player's core health, representing their overall stability. Depletion to 0 ends the run. Can be increased via the meta-progression skill tree.  |
| **Inhibition**   | 100 (Default)     | ~150 (via Outfits)       | **Run-Persistent** | The player's defensive "armor," representing clothing and barriers. Damage persists between encounters. Tied to equippable Outfits. See Wardrobe System below. |
| **Focus**          | 0                 | No Hard Cap              | **Degrades**       | A temporary, turn-based shield generated by **`Defensive`** keyword cards. At the end of the player's turn, any remaining `Focus` is **halved (rounded down)**. It absorbs damage before `Inhibition`. |
| **Action Points (AP)**| 3              | 3 (Can be temp buffed)   | Encounter-Only     | The primary resource for playing cards. Resets to 3 at the start of each player turn.                                |
| **Tension**        | 0                 | 100 (Soft Cap)           | Encounter-Only     | Mental/Verbal resource for playing advanced cards. Generated by `Verbal` cards. Resets to 0 each encounter.                   |
| **Arousal**      | 0                 | 100 (Soft Cap)           | Encounter-Only     | Physical resource for playing advanced cards. Generated by `Physical` cards. Resets to 0 each encounter.                        |

## The "Wardrobe & Maintenance" System

The player's `Inhibition` is a key defensive layer directly tied to their equipped **Outfit**.

*   **Outfits as Items:** Outfits are permanent unlocks acquired through meta-progression (e.g., on the Corporate skill tree). Before a run, the player chooses an outfit from their unlocked collection. Each Outfit provides a `Max Inhibition` value and defines the specific `Inhibition` thresholds that correspond to visual clothing layer changes (e.g., Shirtless at 30 `I`, Exposed at 0 `I`).

*   **Persistent Damage & Threshold Regeneration:**
    1.  Damage to `Player Inhibition` is not fully healed between encounters.
    2.  At the start of a new encounter, the player's current `Inhibition` regenerates **up to the maximum value of its current threshold bracket.** This provides a small, strategic "rebound" mechanic.
        *   *Example:* An outfit has thresholds at 100/75/40. If the player ends a fight with 55 `I`, they will start the next fight with 75 `I`.

*   **In-Run Reinforcements (No Full Repair):** The player **cannot** fully repair a "Ruined" outfit during a run. However, special shop or event nodes may offer the opportunity to acquire **temporary clothing items**.
    *   *Example:* A "Tailor" shop node might sell a "Reinforced Leather Vest" for `Raw Essence`. Equipping this item would grant a temporary pool of **+30 `Inhibition`** for the rest of the run.

*   **The `Exposed` State:** If the player's `Inhibition` bar is depleted to 0, their base Outfit is considered "Ruined" for the rest of the run. They are permanently in the `Exposed` state (unless they acquire temporary clothing), making all subsequent encounters significantly more dangerous.
