# [2.2] The Sex Minigame: Core Combat

The core conflict resolution mechanic is a turn-based card game representing an intimate encounter from a first-person perspective. Each encounter is a duel of `Composure`.

## Objective & Win/Loss Conditions
*   **Player Win Condition:** Reduce the NPC's `Composure` bar to 0.
*   **Player Loss Condition:** The player's own `Composure` bar is reduced to 0. This results in an immediate "Run Failed" state.

## Encounter Flow & Pacing
Encounters are designed as cinematic, ~5-minute events with a target turn count of 6-10 turns for standard NPCs. The flow is governed by the **"Escalation State" System,** where the "neutral pose" of both characters changes at set `Intensity` thresholds, creating a visual progression from a distant approach to close intimacy.

## The Defensive System: "Shield -> Armor -> Body"
Incoming `Composure` loss, for both the player and the NPC, is mitigated by three defensive layers in a strict, sequential order:

1.  **`Focus` (The Shield):** A temporary, turn-based shield generated by `Mental` cards. It absorbs incoming `Composure` loss first. `Focus` degrades by half (rounded down) at the end of each turn, allowing for tactical carry-over.
2.  **`Inhibition` (The Armor):** A semi-persistent resource pool representing clothing and psychological barriers. It absorbs any damage that gets past `Focus`. This entire bar must be depleted before `Composure` can be damaged.
3.  **`Composure` (The Body):** The character's core "health."

## The `Inhibition` & `Guarded` System
This system governs the "Foreplay" phase of an encounter.

*   **`Guarded` Buff:** While a character has `Inhibition` points remaining, they are `Guarded`. This buff has two numerical grades tied to body zones:
    *   `Guarded [Upper]: X`
    *   `Guarded [Lower]: Y`
    *   These numbers represent a percentage damage reduction (e.g., a grade of `3` = 30% reduction) for `Physical` cards targeting that specific zone.

*   **"Progressive Debuff" Thresholds:** Each character's `Inhibition` bar has pre-set thresholds (e.g., at 50%). When `Inhibition` drops below a threshold:
    1.  A layer of clothing is visually removed.
    2.  The corresponding `Guarded` grade is permanently lowered or removed for the rest of the encounter, making that body zone more vulnerable.

*   **Strategic Implications:** This system creates the core tactical puzzle of the Foreplay phase. **`Verbal` cards, which ignore the `Guarded` buff, are the primary tool for efficiently breaking down an opponent's initial `Inhibition`.** `Physical` cards are heavily penalized by `Guarded` and are best used to target a zone *after* its defenses have been broken. This forces the player to adopt a strategic, multi-stage approach rather than simply using their highest-damage cards from turn one.

## The `Exposed` State
This is a critical state change for both the player and the NPC.

*   **Trigger:** A character's `Inhibition` bar is fully depleted.
*   **Effect:** The character is now considered `Exposed`. For the NPC, this means they have lost their `Guarded` buff completely. For the player, this is a dangerous state that may incur penalties.
*   **Crucial Mechanic:** An attacker's most powerful, explicit `Intimate` abilities are **mechanically locked** until their **target is `Exposed`**. This makes breaking the opponent's `Inhibition` (and protecting your own) a primary strategic objective.

## In-Encounter Resource System
The player uses Action Points (AP) to play cards, which generate and spend two primary in-encounter resources. These reset to 0 at the start of every encounter.

*   **`Tension` (Mental Resource):** Generated primarily by `Verbal` cards. Used to power psychological abilities and can amplify or enable certain `Intimate` cards. Max value is 100.
*   **`Arousal` (Physical Resource):** Generated primarily by `Physical` cards. Used to power direct physical actions and `Intimate` cards. Max value is 100.
