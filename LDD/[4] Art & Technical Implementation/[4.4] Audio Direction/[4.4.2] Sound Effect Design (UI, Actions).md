# [4.4.2] Sound Effect (SFX) Design

This document outlines the design philosophy for the game's sound effects. SFX are critical for player feedback, providing weight and impact to actions and making the user interface feel responsive and satisfying.

## Core Principles
*   **Clarity:** The player must be able to understand what happened purely through sound.
*   **Impact:** Actions should feel satisfying. A high-damage card should sound powerful.
*   **Thematic Cohesion:** The sounds should fit our "futuristic, clean, but sensual" aesthetic.

## UI Sound Effects
The User Interface sounds should be minimalist, clean, and non-intrusive. They should feel like interacting with a high-end holographic display.

*   **Button Clicks / Hovers:** Soft, clean "clicks" and "swooshes." Avoid harsh or overly digital sounds.
*   **Resource Gain (`Tension`/`Arousal`):** A subtle, satisfying "ping" or "chime" that increases slightly in pitch as more resources are gained. `Tension` could have a more crystalline sound, while `Arousal` could have a warmer, more liquid sound.
*   **Card Draw:** The sound of a digital file being loaded, a soft "fwoop."
*   **Defensive (`Focus` Gain):** A sharp, calming, "shing" or energy shield hum, as defined in the `Steel Your Nerves` card.

## Sex Combat Action Sound Effects
This is where the sound design must be explicit and immersive. We are not using abstract "hit" sounds.

### **Player Card Actions**
*   **`Verbal` Cards:** The primary sound will be the player's **spoken voice line**. This will be accompanied by a subtle whoosh or electronic effect corresponding to the "Subtitled Intent" visual to give it a sense of impact.
*   **`Physical` Cards (Non-Intimate):** These should be grounded in realism.
    *   `Caress Her Thigh`: The soft sound of a hand brushing against fabric.
    *   `Fondle Her Breasts`: A combination of cloth rustling and a soft fleshy sound, paired with the NPC's breathy reaction.
*   **`Intimate` & `Position:` Cards:** The sound design must be explicit and powerful. This will involve a combination of wet, fleshy sounds, skin-on-skin contact, and most importantly, the clear, unambiguous moans, gasps, and breaths of the participating characters. The audio will be the primary vehicle for conveying the intensity of these actions.

### **NPC Abilities**
*   The same principles apply. Each action must have a distinct, clear sound profile.
*   **`Check Your Hardware`:** The sound of fabric rubbing and a firm, grasping sound.
*   **`Breast Squeeze & Giggle`:** The sound should focus on the NPC's breathy moan and subsequent giggle, not just the physical action.
*   **`Begin Oral Exam`:** The audio here will be one of the most explicit in the game, focusing on wet, slick sounds and the NPC's breathing to sell the reality of the act from the player's FPV.

By focusing on a clean UI soundscape and a realistic, explicit set of combat SFX, the audio will work in concert with the visuals to create a deeply immersive and satisfying player experience.
