# [4.2.1] Core Art Style: Stylized Realism

This document defines the target art style for Project Cygnus. A consistent and well-defined art direction is critical for establishing the game's tone, mood, and overall brand identity.

## Guiding Philosophy: Believable Fantasy
The goal is to create visuals that are immersive and feel "real" within the game's sci-fi context, but are clearly and intentionally a form of digital art. We are explicitly avoiding photorealism or styles that attempt to perfectly mimic real people. The fantasy is paramount.

**Our target aesthetic is "Stylized Realism."**

## Core Components of Stylized Realism

### **1. Character Design:**
*   **Proportions:** Characters will have largely realistic human proportions. We will avoid hyper-exaggerated anatomy (e.g., impossibly large breasts or waists) to maintain a sense of grounded realism.
*   **Features:** Facial features will be well-defined but slightly idealized. Think of high-end video game characters from franchises like *Final Fantasy*, *Resident Evil*, or *Genshin Impact*, where features are clean, symmetrical, and expressive.
*   **Texturing & Shading:** This is the key element. Skin will have texture, but it will be clean and smooth, not photo-realistically porous. Lighting will be soft and cinematic, designed to be flattering and to accentuate form. There will be a clear "digital painting" or "high-end 3D render" quality to the characters. They are unambiguously works of art.

### **2. Environment & Backgrounds:**
*   The environments within the VR simulation will be clean, futuristic, and often minimalist. They will draw from a "corporate sci-fi" aesthetic: sleek lines, glowing holographic elements, and a cool color palette (blues, whites, blacks) punctuated by accent colors.
*   The goal is to create a backdrop that is visually interesting but does not distract from the characters, who are the primary focus of every scene.

### **3. Color Palette:**
*   **Overall:** A cool, desaturated color palette will dominate the environments and UI to evoke the sterile, corporate nature of the simulation.
*   **Characters:** The characters themselves will be the primary source of vibrant color. Their hair, eyes, and outfits will "pop" against the clean backgrounds.
*   **Emotional Highs:** During moments of high intensity (e.g., during a `Position` sub-game or when a character is about to orgasm), the lighting and color palette can shift dramatically, becoming warmer and more saturated to reflect the emotional state of the scene.

## GenAI Prompting Keywords
To achieve this style with our GenAI pipeline, prompts will consistently include tags that steer the model towards this aesthetic.

*   **Positive Tags:** `masterpiece`, `best quality`, `ultra-detailed`, `cinematic lighting`, `(stylized:1.2)`, `digital painting (medium)`, `game cg`, `clean lines`, `sharp focus`.
*   **Negative Tags:** `(photograph, realistic, photorealistic:1.4)`, `blurry`, `messy`, `sketch`.

By adhering to this style, we will create a game that is visually stunning, thematically coherent, and clearly positions itself as a high-quality, professional piece of interactive fiction.
