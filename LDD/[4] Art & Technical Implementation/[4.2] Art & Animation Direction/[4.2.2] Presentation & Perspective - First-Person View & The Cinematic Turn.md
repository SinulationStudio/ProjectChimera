# [4.2.2] Presentation & Perspective: First-Person FMV Hybrid

This document defines the game's presentation layer, which is a hybrid of traditional UI elements and a full-motion video (FMV) system. This choice is fundamental to achieving our core design pillar of an immersive, cinematic, and realistic NSFW experience.

## Core Technology: Pre-Rendered Video

The entire game will be presented from a **First-Person Perspective**, but instead of using real-time 3D models, the visual background will be composed of pre-rendered video clips.

- **Engine Component:** Godot's `VideoStreamPlayer` node will be the primary tool for displaying all character interactions and environmental backgrounds.
- **Format:** All video assets will be in the `.webm` format for an optimal balance of quality and file size.

## The "Cinematic Turn" as a Video Sequence

The "Cinematic Turn" philosophy is not just a concept but a literal, technical implementation using video playback. The flow of an encounter is a sequence of triggered video files.

- **Encounter Intro:** An encounter begins with a one-shot intro video (e.g., `Sarah_Intro_Dialogue.webm`).
- **The Neutral State:** After the intro, the system transitions to a looping "neutral state" video (e.g., `Sarah_Neutral_Loop.webm`). This video shows the NPC in a default idle animation. The card game UI is overlaid on top of this looping video.
- **Player & NPC Actions:** Every action, whether a card played by the player or a move by the NPC, triggers a specific, non-looping action video (e.g., `Player_Action_CaressThigh.webm`, `NPC_Reaction_ShyBlush.webm`).
- **Return to Neutral:** After an action video completes, the `VideoStreamPlayer` seamlessly returns to playing the appropriate "neutral state" loop, awaiting the next gameplay event.

This FMV-hybrid approach allows for exceptionally high-fidelity, realistic visuals that would be unachievable in real-time, creating a deeply immersive and visceral experience that directly serves the player fantasy.
