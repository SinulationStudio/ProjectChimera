# [4.1.2] Version Control: Git Setup

This document outlines the project's use of Git for version control. Utilizing version control is a non-negotiable best practice, providing a critical safety net against data loss and allowing for a comprehensive history of all development changes.

## Core Technology: Git
**Git** is the chosen version control system. It is the industry standard for software development and is highly integrated with modern development tools, including Godot and VS Code.

### **Initial Project Setup**
When creating the project in the Godot Project Manager, the setting for **`Version Control Metadata`** must be set to **`Git`**.

*   **Rationale:** This automatically generates a crucial `.gitignore` file within the project directory. This file is pre-configured to tell Git to ignore Godot's temporary, auto-generated cache and import files (such as the `.godot` folder).
*   **Benefit:** This keeps our version control history clean, focused only on meaningful changes to scenes, scripts, and assets. It prevents repository bloat and avoids conflicts caused by machine-specific temporary files.

## Recommended Workflow for a Solo Developer

While we are working as a solo developer, adhering to a professional Git workflow provides immense benefits.

### **1. Local Repository**
The project folder on the local machine will be a Git repository. This provides the core "magical save" functionality.

### **2. Remote Repository (GitHub)**
A private repository on **GitHub** will serve as our secure, off-site backup and the central location for our Living Design Document (LDD).

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Data Redundancy:** Protects against local hardware failure (e.g., hard drive crash).
    *   **LDD Hosting:** GitHub's Markdown rendering makes it the ideal platform for hosting and browsing our LDD.
    *   **History Tracking:** Provides a web interface to easily view the history of all changes.

### **3. Recommended Tool: GitHub Desktop**
To simplify the use of Git for a non-coder, the **GitHub Desktop** application is the recommended tool.

*   **Function:** It provides a simple, graphical user interface (GUI) for all essential Git operations.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Make changes to the game or LDD locally.
    2.  Open GitHub Desktop. It will show a list of all changed files.
    3.  Write a short, descriptive message in the "Summary" box (e.g., "Updated Player Systems LDD file").
    4.  Click **`Commit to main`**. This creates a "snapshot" or magical save on your local machine.
    5.  Click **`Push origin`**. This uploads that snapshot to your private GitHub repository, backing it up.

This simple "Commit and Push" cycle should be performed frequently (e.g., at the end of every work session) to ensure a granular history and minimize potential data loss.
