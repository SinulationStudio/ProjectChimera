# [4.1.3] Development Environment: VS Code Configuration

This document specifies the setup for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), our chosen external editor for writing GDScript. A properly configured editor is essential for our AI-assisted, "text-to-game" workflow.

## Core Principle
Our VS Code environment is designed to be a "smart" partner. It should maximize clarity, automate tedious tasks, provide powerful organizational tools, and seamlessly integrate with both the Godot Engine and AI assistants.

---

## Essential Extensions

These extensions are considered mandatory for our development process. They should be installed from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.

| Extension Name | Publisher | Purpose & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Godot Tools`** | `godotengine` | The official bridge between Godot and VS Code. Provides GDScript syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging capabilities. This is the non-negotiable foundation. |
| **`GitHub Copilot`** | `GitHub` | The core AI "pair programmer." It autocompletes code, suggests entire functions, and dramatically accelerates the process of turning design logic into functional script. |
| **`GitHub Copilot Chat`** | `GitHub` | An integrated chat interface for Copilot. Allows for direct, conversational queries about code, making it an invaluable tool for explaining, debugging, and refactoring scripts. |
| **`Todo Tree`** | `Gruntfuggly` | Scans the project for comments like `// TODO:` and `// FIXME:` and organizes them into a navigable tree view. This is crucial for tracking follow-up tasks and ensuring no design detail is lost. |
| **`GitLens`** | `GitKraken` | Supercharges the built-in Git capabilities, providing detailed, line-by-line history (blame), easy file comparison, and powerful repository navigation tools. |

## Recommended "Quality of Life" Extensions

These extensions are not strictly essential for function but are highly recommended for a more organized and aesthetically pleasing workflow.

| Extension Name | Publisher | Purpose & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Git Graph`** | `mhutchie` | Provides a clean, graphical representation of the Git history (branching, merging), making it much easier to visualize the project's development timeline. |
| **`Project Manager`**| `Alessandro Fragnani` | Allows for easy saving and switching between different project folders (e.g., our main game and reference projects) from within VS Code. |
| **`Material Icon Theme`**| `PKief` | Provides custom, language-specific icons for files in the explorer, making it much easier to identify different file types at a glance. |

## `settings.json` Configuration

The following is the complete `settings.json` configuration for VS Code. It should be used to ensure a consistent and optimized editing environment.

```json
{
    // --- General Editor Quality of Life ---
    "editor.fontFamily": "Cascadia Code, Fira Code, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,

    "editor.renderLineHighlight": "gutter",
    "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",

    // --- Godot & GDScript Specific Settings ---
    // IMPORTANT: This path must be updated to point to the user's Godot 4 executable!
    "godot_tools.editor_path": "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Godot_v4.x.x.exe",

        "editor.tabSize": 4,
        "editor.insertSpaces": true,
        "editor.trimAutoWhitespace": true
    },
    "textEditor.completion.addTypeHints": true, // Renamed from godot_tools to textEditor in newer versions

        "**/.godot": true
    },
