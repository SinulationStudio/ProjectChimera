# [4.3.1] HUD Layout: The In-Encounter Interface

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the Heads-Up Display (HUD) for the core Sex Combat screen. The design philosophy is to be **immersive, clean, and informationally clear,** supporting our First-Person Perspective without overwhelming the player.

## Visual Aesthetic
*   **Style:** Sleek, futuristic, minimalist. Elements should feel like a diegetic part of the player's cybernetic heads-up display.
*   **Theme:** Use of semi-transparent panels, glowing holographic lines, and smooth "fade-in/fade-out" animations via our `TweenAnimator` addon.
*   **Color Palette:** Primarily cool colors (blues, teals, dark greys) for the UI frames, with vibrant, hot colors (reds, oranges, pinks) used for resource bars to create a strong visual contrast.

## On-Screen Element Layout

This describes the layout from the player's FPV.

### **Center Screen (The Focus)**
*   **NPC Character Art:** The primary visual element. A high-resolution, expressive character model/sprite occupies the center of the view. Their pose and expression will change based on the "Escalation State."
*   **NPC Status Bars:** Positioned directly **below** the NPC character art for clear association.
    1.  **`Composure` Bar (Red):** The NPC's main health bar. Large and prominent.
    2.  **`Inhibition` Bars (Blue/Green):** Two smaller bars directly above the Composure bar, representing `Upper Inhibition` and `Lower Inhibition`. These will deplete and disappear when broken.
    3.  **`Focus` Shield:** A glowing, hexagonal number that appears overlaid on the left end of the Composure bar when the NPC has a `Focus` shield.
*   **NPC Intent Icon:** A simple, clear icon appears next to the NPC's status bars during the player's turn, telegraphing the NPC's next action (e.g., a `Red Sword with -10` for a Composure attack).

### **Bottom of Screen (The Player's "Cockpit")**
This area contains the player's primary interactive elements.

*   **Card Hand:** Displayed in a gentle arc at the bottom center. Cards should be large and clear. Hovering over a card could bring it to the foreground and display its full text.
*   **Action Points (AP):** A series of 3-5 glowing orbs or pips located in the bottom-left corner, near the player's resources. Easy to see how many actions are remaining.
*   **Draw & Discard Piles:** Represented as two small, stylized deck icons on the far-left and far-right of the screen, below the card hand arc. Each has a number indicating the cards remaining.

### **Left & Right Periphery (Player Status)**
These elements should be placed on the sides of the screen, like readouts on a helmet visor. They should be clear but less prominent than the center-screen elements.

*   **Left Side - Defensive Vitals:**
    1.  **Player `Composure` Bar (Red):** A vertical or L-shaped bar on the left edge of the screen.
    2.  **Player `Inhibition` Bars (Blue/Green):** Two smaller bars next to the player's Composure bar.
    3.  **Player `Focus` Shield:** A number appearing over the Composure bar, mirroring the NPC's display.

*   **Right Side - Offensive Resources:**
    1.  **`Tension` Counter (Blue):** A numerical value (`e.g., 45/100`) next to a stylized "mind" or "wave" icon.
    2.  **`Arousal` Counter (Pink/Orange):** A numerical value (`e.g., 30/100`) next to a stylized "hand" or "heartbeat" icon.

This layout ensures that the player's focus remains on the NPC in the center of the screen, while all necessary strategic information is available in their periphery with a quick glance.
