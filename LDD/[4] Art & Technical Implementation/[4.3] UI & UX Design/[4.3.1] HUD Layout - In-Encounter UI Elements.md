# [4.3.1] HUD Layout: The In-Encounter Interface

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the Heads-Up Display (HUD) for the core Sex Combat screen. The design philosophy is to be **immersive, clean, and informationally clear,** supporting our First-Person Perspective without overwhelming the player.

## Visual Aesthetic
*   **Style:** Sleek, futuristic, minimalist. Elements should feel like a diegetic part of the player's cybernetic heads-up display.
*   **Theme:** Use of semi-transparent panels, glowing holographic lines, and smooth "fade-in/fade-out" animations via our `TweenAnimator` addon.
*   **Color Palette:** Primarily cool colors (blues, teals, dark greys) for the UI frames, with vibrant, hot colors (magenta for `Arousal`, crimson for `Composure`) used for resource bars to create a strong visual contrast.

## On-Screen Element Layout

This describes the layout from the player's FPV.

### **Center Screen (The Focus)**
*   **NPC Character Art:** The primary visual element. A high-resolution, expressive character model/sprite occupies the center of the view. Their pose and expression will change based on the "Escalation State."
*   **NPC Status Bars:** Positioned directly **below** the NPC character art for clear association.
    1.  **`Composure` Bar (Crimson):** The NPC's main health bar. Large and prominent.
    2.  **`Inhibition` Bar (Teal):** A single segmented bar representing clothing integrity. Segments disappear as thresholds break (e.g., 66%, 33%, 0%).
    3.  **`Guard` Callout:** A hexagonal number that appears above the `Composure` bar when the NPC has temporary protection from `Defensive` abilities.
    4.  **`Arousal` Meter:** A slim, magenta bar that climbs alongside the `Composure` bar, showing the shared escalation pressure.
*   **NPC Intent Icon:** A simple, clear icon appears next to the NPC's status bars during the player's turn, telegraphing the NPC's next action (e.g., a `Red Sword with -10` for a `Composure` attack).

### **Bottom of Screen (The Player's "Cockpit")**
This area contains the player's primary interactive elements.

*   **Card Hand:** Displayed in a gentle arc at the bottom center. Cards should be large and clear. Hovering over a card should bring it to the foreground and display its full text.
*   **Action Points (AP):** A series of 3-5 glowing orbs or pips located in the bottom-left corner, near the player's resources. Easy to see how many actions are remaining.
*   **Draw & Discard Piles:** Represented as two small, stylized deck icons on the far-left and far-right of the screen, below the card hand arc. Each has a number indicating the cards remaining.

### **Left & Right Periphery (Player Status)**
These elements should be placed on the sides of the screen, like readouts on a helmet visor. They should be clear but less prominent than the center-screen elements.

*   **Left Side - Defensive Vitals:**
    1.  **Player `Composure` Bar (Crimson):** A vertical or L-shaped bar on the left edge of the screen.
    2.  **Player `Inhibition` Bar (Teal):** A segmented bar next to the player's `Composure` bar, mirroring the NPC's layout.
    3.  **Player `Guard` Value:** A number appearing over the `Composure` bar, mirroring the NPC's display.

*   **Right Side - Offensive Pressure:**
    1.  **Shared `Arousal` Meter:** Mirrored readout of the center meter to emphasize that both sides push the same track.
    2.  **`Self Arousal` Counter:** Displays how close the player is to losing control. If it hits 100, the UI should flash to warn the player before an involuntary `Climax` trigger.

This layout ensures that the player's focus remains on the NPC in the center of the screen, while all necessary strategic information is available in their periphery with a quick glance.
