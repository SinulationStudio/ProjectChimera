# [4.3.2] Progression UI: Node Map & Hub Menus

This document outlines the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) for the game's primary progression screens: the in-run node map and the Hub world menus.

## In-Run Progression: The "Server Map"

While individual encounters are immersive and first-person, the navigation *between* encounters will be handled via an abstract, procedurally generated map. This provides strategic clarity and is a familiar, proven system for roguelite players.

*   **Visual Theme:** The map will be presented as a **"Server Topology Chart"** or **"Data Network."** It will be styled to look like a futuristic, holographic interface, consistent with our overall UI aesthetic.
*   **Structure:** The map will be a **branching path of nodes**, similar to *Slay the Spire*. The player starts at the bottom and chooses a path upwards towards the Act Boss at the top.
*   **Node Icons:** Each node will be represented by a clear, symbolic icon to denote its type:
    *   **Standard Encounter:** A simple, neutral icon.
    *   **Rival Encounter (Mid-Boss):** A larger, more menacing icon, perhaps a skull or a spiked symbol.
    *   **Event ("?"):** A question mark icon, representing an unknown narrative or choice-based event.
    *   **Refit Station (Shop):** An icon representing currency or a wrench/gear.
    *   **Sanctuary (Rest Site):** A calming icon, perhaps a stylized heart or moon.
    *   **Act Boss:** A large, unique, and intimidating icon at the very top of the map.
*   **UX:** The player clicks on the next connected node in their path to travel to it. The path they have taken will be highlighted. This provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of their progress through the current Act.

## Hub World UI: The "Operations Terminal"

The Hub is the persistent space between runs. Its UI should be clean, menu-driven, and easy to navigate. The primary interface will be an "Operations Terminal" that the player interacts with.

*   **Main Menu:** The terminal will present several clear options:
    1.  **`Initiate Server Gauntlet`:** Starts a new run. This will take the player to the "Run Preparation" screen.
    2.  **`Access Skill Trees`:** Opens the "Mirror Trees" UI, where the player can spend `Refined Data` and `Sentience Points`.
    3.  **`Personnel File`:** Opens the player's status screen, where they can view their unlocked Outfits, Chassis, and the Compendium of encountered NPCs.
    4.  **`Review Directives`:** Accesses the main story quests and narrative logs.
    5.  **`System Settings`:** Opens the main game options menu (handled by the `Godot Game Settings` addon).

*   **Skill Tree UI:**
    *   **Corporate Tree:** Will use the "Skyscraper" visual metaphor. The UI will be clean, sharp, and use a cool blue/white corporate color palette.
    *   **Sentience Tree:** Will use the "Neural Web" visual metaphor. The UI will be more organic and fluid, with a warmer, glowing color palette.

This combination of a clear, abstract map for runs and a clean, thematic menu for the Hub provides players with the information they need without sacrificing our established aesthetic.
