# [4.3.3] Combat UI: The Minimalist Visor

This document outlines the design and implementation blueprint for the Sex Combat user interface, based on the "Minimalist Visor" concept. It serves as the primary technical and artistic reference for building the in-game HUD in Godot.

**Design Philosophy:** The UI must be clean, immersive, and informationally clear. It is a diegetic interface, representing what the android player sees on a cybernetic visor or contact lens. The design prioritizes an unobstructed view of the opponent, pushing most player-centric information to the periphery, while reimagining cards as "Minimalist Data Fragments."

## 1. HUD Layout & Element Positioning

This layout ensures the player's focus remains on the NPC in the center of the screen.

*   **Center Screen (The Focus):**
    *   **NPC Character:** The primary visual. Their pose and expression are paramount.
    *   **NPC Vitals Cluster:** Positioned directly **below** the NPC for clear association.
        *   `Composure` Bar (Red): Large, primary horizontal bar.
        *   `Inhibition` Bars (Blue/Green): Smaller bars above Composure.
        *   `Focus` Shield: Numerical value overlaid on the left of the Composure bar.
        *   `Intent` Icon: A clear icon telegraphing the NPC's next action appears next to this cluster.

*   **Screen Periphery (Player Vitals):**
    *   **Left Edge:** A vertical `L-shaped` bar representing the player's `Composure` and `Inhibition` levels.
    *   **Right Edge:** Clean numerical readouts for `Tension` (Blue) and `Arousal` (Pink/Orange), each paired with a simple, stylized icon.

*   **Bottom of Screen (Player Cockpit):**
    *   **Card Hand:** A gentle arc of 5 "Minimalist Data Fragment" panels at the bottom of the screen. They are slightly transparent until hovered.
    *   **Action Points (AP):** A series of 3-5 glowing pips in the bottom-left corner.
    *   **Draw & Discard Piles:** Two simple, stylized deck icons on the far-left and far-right, below the hand, each with a numerical counter.

## 2. The Card as "Minimalist Data Fragment"

We are abandoning the traditional rectangular card metaphor in favor of something more diegetic. Cards are "subroutines" or "actions" visualized as panes of holographic glass.

### `Card.tscn` Godot Scene Blueprint

*   **Root Node:** `PanelContainer`
    *   **Style:** Use a `StyleBoxFlat` with a semi-transparent background color and no borders.
*   **Children Nodes:**
    *   `TextureRect` (named `CardArt`): The main visual space. This will eventually display our GenAI-generated looping videos or images. For the MVE, a placeholder texture will suffice.
    *   `Label` (named `NameLabel`): Top-center. Displays the card's name.
    *   `Label` (named `CostLabel`): Top-left corner. Displays the AP cost.
    *   `RichTextLabel` (named `EffectLabel`): Bottom half. Describes the card's mechanics. Keywords will be color-coded using BBCode.
    *   `HBoxContainer` (named `ResourceIcons`): For displaying resource generator/spender icons (Tension, Arousal) if applicable.

### Interaction & Animation

*   **Hover:** When hovered, a `Tween` will slightly increase the panel's scale and make its background fully opaque for better readability.
*   **Play:** On play, the panel will animate towards the center of the screen before fading out, triggering the action.

## 3. Style Guide

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **UI Panels & Text:** Off-whites, light teals, and dark greys for a clean, futuristic look. (`#EAEAEA`, `#5DBCD2`, `#222222`)
    *   **Player Resources:** Use hot, vibrant colors for high contrast and immediate recognition.
        *   `Composure`: Red (`#FF4141`)
        *   `Tension`: Bright Blue (`#00FFFF`)
        *   `Arousal`: Hot Pink/Orange (`#FF69B4` / `#FFA500`)
    *   **Keywords:** Use BBCode in `RichTextLabel` to color keywords (e.g., `[color=#00FFFF]Verbal[/color]`).

*   **Typography:**
    *   **Font:** A clean, readable sans-serif font. "Roboto" or "Montserrat" are good candidates to import.
    *   **Hierarchy:** Use different font sizes and weights to distinguish card names from effect text.

*   **Animation Philosophy:**
    *   All UI animations should be smooth, fast, and non-intrusive. Use Godot's `Tween` node for fades, movement, and scaling. Avoid jarring or overly long animations that slow down gameplay.
