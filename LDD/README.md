# Project Chimera - Living Design Document (v2.0)

Welcome to the central design document for Project Chimera (working title `NSFW_RLDB`). This document is the single source of truth for all mechanics, narrative, and design decisions. It is a living document and will be updated continuously.

## Core Pillars
*   **Deep, Strategic Gameplay:** A deck-builder with multiple resource systems and tactical depth.
*   **Immersive Narrative:** A branching, character-driven story with meaningful choices.
*   **Uncompromising NSFW Content:** Explicit, consensual, adult themes and visuals presented from a cinematic, first-person perspective.
*   **Player-Driven Discovery:** Systems are designed to be learned through gameplay, rewarding observation and mastery.
