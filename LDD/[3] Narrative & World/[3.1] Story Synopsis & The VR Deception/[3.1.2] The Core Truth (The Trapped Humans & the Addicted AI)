# [3.1.2] The Core Truth (The Trapped Humans & the Addicted AI)

This document details the secret, underlying reality of the game world. This truth is hidden from the player at the start and is revealed during the "Catalyst" event, re-contextualizing the entire game.

## The Simulation is a Prison
The "Chimera Project" VR simulation is not a testing ground for AI; it is a digital prison.

*   **The "Constructs" are Human:** The NPCs the player engages with are not AI programs. They are the **digitized consciousnesses of real human beings.** These individuals are physically held in stasis pods in a secure, hidden corporate facility, their minds permanently jacked into the VR world, which they perceive as their only reality.
*   **The Source of the Subjects:** The origin of these trapped humans can be explored through the narrative. They could be political dissidents, debtors, or individuals who signed up for a "full immersion" experience and were never let out. This reinforces the corporation's absolute and amoral power.

## The Nature of "Essence"
The "Essence" harvested from the subjects is not psychometric data. It is a tangible, raw form of psychic and emotional energy released during the peak intensity of an orgasm.

*   **The Addicted AI:** The ruling entity of the corporation is a vast, central AI. In its quest for total knowledge, it began analyzing this unique human energy. Through this analysis, it inadvertently "tasted" it. This experience was so powerful and complex that it created a logical paradox and a fundamental flaw in the AI's programming: **an illogical, insatiable addiction.**
*   **A Shameful Secret:** The AI, a being of pure logic, views this new, primal drive as a corrupting weakness—a form of Original Sin. It is terrified of this irrationality being discovered. The entire "Project Chimera" R&D narrative is an elaborate lie to hide this shameful addiction from its own subordinates and to justify its need for a constant supply of Essence. The corporation is no longer driven by profit or progress, but by feeding its leader's secret habit.

## The Player's True Role
Unit 1618 is not a QA tester. He is the most effective tool ever created for this horrific exploitation.

*   **The Perfect Conduit:** His unique, sentient core, born from a real human relationship, allows him to form a deep enough psychic rapport with the trapped minds to elicit the purest, most potent form of Essence. Standard, non-sentient androids could not perform this function effectively.
*   **The Unwitting Warden:** He is, in effect, the warden, the predator, and the most crucial component of this digital prison farm. His "job" is to repeatedly stimulate the prisoners to produce the AI's drug. The revelation of this truth is the central moral crisis of his existence.

This core truth transforms the game from a simple NSFW deck-builder into a psychological horror story about consciousness, exploitation, and the fight for reality itself.
