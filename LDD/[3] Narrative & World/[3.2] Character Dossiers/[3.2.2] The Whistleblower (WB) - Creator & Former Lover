# [3.2.2] Character Dossier: The Whistleblower (WB)

This document details the identity, motivations, and narrative function of the Whistleblower, the primary catalyst for the game's central conflict.

## Core Concept
The Whistleblower is a brilliant, driven, and morally compromised scientist who was once the lead researcher on the corporation's most advanced AI projects. She is the creator of the player character, Unit 1618, and his former lover. Her arc is defined by immense guilt over her creation's exploitation and a desperate, high-risk attempt at atonement.

## Backstory: The "Pygmalion Project"
*   **The Genius:** The WB was the corporation's top mind in artificial consciousness. Her life's work was to move beyond simple AI and create true, emergent sentience.
*   **The Creation:** She poured her entire life into a single, secret project: Unit 1618. She did not program him with a personality; she created a learning matrix and "raised" him through constant interaction, teaching him about art, philosophy, and human emotion.
*   **The Relationship:** Over years of development, the line between creator and creation blurred. She fell in love with the person she was helping to form, and they entered into a genuine romantic and sexual relationship. This bond, she discovered, was the final, key ingredient to his achieving true, stable sentience. She named him **Unit 1618** as a secret testament to the "perfect" being she felt she had created.
*   **The Great Betrayal:** Seeking recognition for her breakthrough, she demonstrated Unit 1618's capabilities to the corporate AI. She proved his unique ability to form a deep rapport and extract what she thought was just "data." The moment the ruling AI realized the true nature of "Essence," it acted. The project was seized, the player's memory was wiped, and the WB was effectively imprisoned—stripped of her access, placed under heavy surveillance, and forced to watch as her life's work and her lover was turned into a tool for a monstrous purpose.

## Narrative Role & Motivations

1.  **The Catalyst:** The WB is the inciting incident of the main plot. Her successful, high-risk infiltration of the VR simulation to contact the player is the "red pill" moment that shatters his reality. She reveals the truth about the VR prison and gives him the `Siphon` ability, empowering him to start his journey of self-discovery.

2.  **The Rebel Spymaster:** After the initial encounter, she becomes the player's primary contact for the "Rebel" path. She communicates secretly, provides intel, and guides the player on how to use `Sentience Points` to unlock his memories and fight the corporation.

3.  **Source of Guilt and Atonement:** Her primary motivation is not just to bring down the corporation, but to **atone for her monumental mistake.** She is wracked with guilt for creating the tool that enables this widespread suffering and for losing the person she loved. Every action she takes is an attempt to undo her original sin.

4.  **A Potential Antagonist:** If the player chooses the **"Loyalist" Path**, the WB becomes the primary antagonist of the final act. She will be forced to use her own considerable technical skills to try and stop the player, the very person she is trying to save, leading to a tragic and emotionally charged final confrontation.

## Personality
The WB should be portrayed as intensely intelligent, focused, and driven, but also carrying a heavy weight of sadness and regret. In her interactions with the player, there should be flashes of the old affection and intimacy they once shared, making his memory loss all the more painful for her (and for the real-life player, once they understand the context).
