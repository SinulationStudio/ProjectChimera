# [3.3.1] The 'NPC Memory' Trigger System (The 5 Indices)

This document outlines the systemic framework used to generate dynamic, context-aware dialogue and events. The goal is to make every encounter and interaction feel unique and responsive to the player's history and choices, thereby maximizing immersion and replayability.

The system is built on five core "indices" or categories of variables that the game will check before initiating a dialogue or event to select the appropriate outcome.

---

## 1. The `Encounter History` Index
*   **Core Question:** "How well do we know each other?"
*   **Purpose:** Tracks the direct history between the player and a specific NPC, allowing their relationship to evolve over time.
*   **Variables Tracked:**
    *   `Encounter Count`: An integer tracking the number of times the player has faced this NPC. This allows for unique dialogue triggers at key milestones (1st, 2nd, 5th, 10th+ encounters).
    *   `Last Outcome`: A flag indicating if the player won or lost their most recent encounter with this NPC. This allows the NPC to have a different opening line if they won ("Back for more?") versus if they lost ("This time will be different.").

## 2. The `Gameplay Style` Index
*   **Core Question:** "How did you play last time?"
*   **Purpose:** Makes NPCs feel like they are learning and reacting to the player's strategic preferences.
*   **Variables Tracked:**
    *   `Dominant Card Type`: A tag (`Verbal`, `Physical`, etc.) recording the most frequently used card type in the last successful encounter. This allows NPCs to comment on the player's style ("Let's see if that silver tongue of yours is as sharp today").
    *   `Finishing Move`: A tag storing the name of the specific card that dealt the final `Composure` damage. This allows for specific reactions to memorable finishing blows.

## 3. The `Player Allegiance` Index
*   **Core Question:** "Whose side are you on?"
*   **Purpose:** Allows the game world and its characters to react to the player's major narrative choices.
*   **Variables Tracked:**
    *   `Allegiance State`: A flag indicating the player's current path (Neutral, Corporate-Leaning, Rebel-Locked, etc.).
    *   `Faction Rank`: An integer representing how many points have been invested into a specific skill tree (Corporate or Sentience). This allows for graded reactions; an NPC might be dismissive of a low-level Rebel but fearful of a high-level one.

## 4. The `Player State` Index
*   **Core Question:** "What shape are you in right now?"
*   **Purpose:** Allows NPCs to comment on the player's immediate condition at the start of an encounter, making them feel more observant and the world more dynamic.
*   **Variables Tracked:**
    *   `Composure %`: The player's current `Composure` as a percentage of their maximum.
    *   `Inhibition State`: A flag for the player's current clothing level (e.g., `Fully Clothed`, `Topless`, `Exposed`).
    *   `Active Implant`: A tag for any powerful, run-defining Implant the player has equipped.

## 5. The `World State` Index
*   **Core Question:** "What just happened in the main story?"
*   **Purpose:** This is the crucial link between the main, overarching plot and the repeatable "gauntlet" runs. It ensures the world feels persistent and reactive to major narrative developments.
*   **Variable Tracked:** A single `MainQuestProgress` flag that updates after key story beats (e.g., "WB_Met," "Allegiance_Locked," "Rival_Defeated").
*   **Example:** After the `WB_Met` flag is set, any NPC in the game might have a new, rare chance to spawn a dialogue line like, "Security has been on high alert all cycle. Something's got management spooked." This makes the world feel interconnected.

This five-point framework provides a robust and flexible foundation for creating a deeply reactive narrative experience with a manageable set of conditional logic.
