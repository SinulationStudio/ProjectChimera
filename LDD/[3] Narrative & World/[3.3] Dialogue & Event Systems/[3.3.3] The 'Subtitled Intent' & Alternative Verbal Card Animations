# [3.3.3] Verbal Card Animations

This document outlines the design principles for visually representing `Verbal` card plays to ensure they are immersive, impactful, and thematically consistent with our FPV "Cinematic Turn" philosophy. The challenge is to make a spoken action feel as tangible as a physical one.

## Primary Method: "Subtitled Intent"

This is our default and recommended approach for most `Verbal` cards. It combines audio, stylized visual effects, and NPC reaction to create a complete cinematic moment.

**Sequence of Events:**

1.  **Card Play:** Player plays a `Verbal` card (e.g., `Make Her Blush`).
2.  **Audio Cue:** A pre-recorded voice line from the player character plays. Each `Verbal` card will have a pool of 3-5 appropriate lines to prevent repetition.
3.  **Visual Effect (The "Subtitle"):** As the line is spoken, the key words or the entire phrase will materialize briefly on-screen as a **stylized visual element**.
    *   This is **not** a UI text box. It is an artistic effect integrated into the game world, like a holographic projection or a psychic impression.
    *   The font, color, and animation of the text will match the card's tone. A gentle compliment might use a soft, flowing script in a warm color. An aggressive taunt might use a sharp, glitchy font in a stark red.
    *   The text will emanate from the player's implied position and drift towards the NPC before dissipating upon impact.
4.  **NPC Reaction:** The NPC's animation is the final and most crucial component. They will react realistically to the content of the voice line (e.g., blushing, smirking, shivering, looking away).
5.  **Resolution:** The `Composure` damage number appears as the NPC reacts.

**Rationale:** This method provides perfect clarity, adds significant artistic flair, avoids breaking immersion with traditional UI, and is highly flexible for conveying different emotional tones.

## Alternative & Supplementary Animation Models

These models can be used for specific, high-impact cards or to add variety.

### **Alternative 1: The "Aural Ripple" / Synesthesia Model**

*   **Concept:** Represents the player's voice as a visible wave of force or energy, leaning into the sci-fi VR theme.
*   **Execution:** Instead of text, a stylized soundwave (e.g., a blue ripple for a calm word, a red spike for an aggressive one) emanates from the player and washes over the NPC, triggering their reaction animation.
*   **Best Use Case:** Could be used for `Mental` or `Defensive` cards like `Steel Your Nerves`, where a wave of focusing energy visually represents the effect without needing words.

### **Alternative 2: The "Psychological Overlay" Model**

*   **Concept:** A powerful verbal attack momentarily "hacks" the screen, showing an abstract representation of the feeling being inflicted.
*   **Execution:** For a brief moment, the screen is taken over by a full-screen visual effect—a soft pink glow for a loving phrase, or a harsh red static for a demeaning one.
*   **Best Use Case:** This should be reserved for **rare, ultimate-level `Verbal` Spender cards.** Its high visual impact makes it feel like a "super move" and should not be overused, to avoid disorienting the player.

By combining these techniques—using "Subtitled Intent" as our workhorse, "Aural Ripples" for non-verbal mental effects, and "Psychological Overlays" for finishers—we can create a rich and dynamic visual language for all non-physical interactions in the game.
