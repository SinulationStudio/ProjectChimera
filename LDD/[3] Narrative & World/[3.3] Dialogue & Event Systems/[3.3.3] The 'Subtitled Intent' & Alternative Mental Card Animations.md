# [3.3.3] Mental Card Animations

This document outlines the design principles for visually representing `Mental` card plays. The challenge is to make a non-physical action feel tangible, as impactful as a physical strike.

## Primary Method: "Subtitled Intent"

This is our default and recommended approach for most `Mental` cards. It combines audio design, stylized visual effects, and NPC reaction to create an immersive, "inside the character's head" experience.

**Sequence of Events:**

1.  **Card Play:** Player plays a `Mental` card (e.g., `Mind's Eye`).
2.  **Focus Surge:** The player's mental focus causes a stylized pulse to flare around their head, styled per card family.
3.  **Visual Effect (The "Subtitle"):** The card's intent materializes briefly on-screen as a stylized text or symbol, representing the thought being projected.
    *   This is **not** a UI text box. It is an artistic effect integrated into the game world—like a psychic projection or neon imprint on reality.
    *   The font, color, and animation align with the card's tone. A supportive thought might flow in warm, soft colors; an aggressive jab might spike in harsh, glitchy forms.
    *   The text/symbol emanates from the player's implied position and drifts toward the NPC before dispersing on contact.
4.  **NPC Reaction:** The NPC's expression, animation, or aura changes to show the thought piercing their defenses (e.g., a stagger, momentary freeze, eyes widening).
5.  **Resolution:** The `Mental` damage number appears as the NPC reacts, completing the effect.

**Rationale:** This method provides perfect clarity, adds significant artistic flair, avoids breaking immersion with traditional UI, and remains flexible enough to convey very different emotional tones.

## Alternative & Supplementary Animation Models

These models can be used for specific, high-impact cards or to add variety.

### **Alternative 1: The "Aural Ripple" / Synesthesia Model**

*   **Concept:** Represents the player's mental voice as a visible wave of force or emotion, leaning into the sci-fi VR theme.
*   **Execution:** Instead of text, a stylized soundwave (e.g., a blue ripple for a calming focus, a red spike for an aggressive jab) emanates from the player and washes over the NPC, triggering their reaction animation.
*   **Best Use Case:** Could be used for `Mental` or `Support` cards like `Steady Breath`, where a wave of focus visually represents the effect without words.

### **Alternative 2: The "Psychological Overlay" Model**

*   **Concept:** A powerful mental attack momentarily "hacks" the screen, showcasing an abstract representation of the feeling being inflicted.
*   **Execution:** For a brief moment, the screen is taken over by a full-screen visual effect—a soft pink bloom for affection, or a harsh red static for domination.
*   **Best Use Case:** This should be reserved for **rare, ultimate-level `Mental` Spender cards.** Its high visual impact makes it feel like a "super move" and should be deployed sparingly to avoid player fatigue.

By combining these techniques—using "Subtitled Intent" as our workhorse, "Aural Ripples" for non-verbal mental effects, and "Psychological Overlays" for finishers—we can create a rich and dynamic visual language for all non-physical interactions in the game.
