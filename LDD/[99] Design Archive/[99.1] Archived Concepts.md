# [99.1] Archived Concepts

This document serves as a historical record of significant design concepts that were considered for Project Cygnus but were ultimately replaced by different systems. The rationale for each decision is preserved here for context and to inform future design discussions.

## **Archived Concept: "Social Engineering / Spy Noir" Model**
*   **Date Archived:** Session corresponding to LDD v2.0 creation.
*   **Concept:** The game's core premise was set in the physical world. Runs were framed as "heists" or "missions" (e.g., "Infiltrate a Corporate Gala"). Encounters were with real-world obstacles like security guards, rival agents, or corporate executives who were overcome via seduction and social maneuvering.
*   **Rationale for Archiving:** While a strong narrative concept, the **"VR Deception" model** was ultimately chosen for two key reasons:
    1.  **Stronger Roguelite Justification:** The VR simulation provides a cleaner and more direct in-universe explanation for core roguelite mechanics like run resets ("rebooting a simulation"), procedural generation ("randomized server blocks"), and why the player repeatedly faces a pool of NPCs.
    2.  **More Potent Thematic Core:** The psychological horror of discovering the NPCs are trapped human minds was deemed a more unique and powerful narrative hook than the more traditional spy thriller.

## **Archived Concept: "Diegetic Menu / Clue-like" Interface**
*   **Date Archived:** Session corresponding to LDD v2.0 creation.
*   **Concept:** In place of a traditional node map, the player would navigate a run via a persistent, diegetic menu of "actions" available within a single location (e.g., at the Gala, actions were "Approach the Bar," "Mingle with VIPs," etc.).
*   **Rationale for Archiving:** While highly immersive, there were significant concerns that a purely static version of this menu would lack the procedural variety and replayability essential for a roguelite. A standard, procedurally generated **node map** (themed as a "Server Topology Chart") was chosen as a more robust and familiar system for ensuring run-to-run variety. The diegetic concept remains a potential inspiration for specific, self-contained "Event" nodes.

## **Archived Concept: NPCs as Digital "ICE"**
*   **Date Archived:** Session corresponding to LDD v1.0 refinement.
*   **Concept:** The standard enemies in the VR world were proposed to be sentient security programs (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) with simulated personalities that had to be "seduced" to be bypassed.
*   **Rationale for Archiving:** Discarded due to a severe thematic and aesthetic disconnect. The act of using explicit, physical cards like `Caress Her Thigh` against an abstract piece of software named "Firewall" was determined to be immersion-breaking and detrimental to the game's core erotic appeal. The "Human-First" mandate was established instead.

## **Archived Concept: Single `Essence` Pool (Health + Currency)**
*   **Date Archived:** Session corresponding to LDD v1.0 refinement.
*   **Concept:** The player's health (`Composure`) and their in-run currency were a single, shared resource pool. Taking damage would reduce the currency available for upgrades.
*   **Rationale for Archiving:** Deemed too confusing for players and created significant balancing challenges (e.g., risk of infinite health stacking and "death spiral" runs). Replaced by the much clearer two-pool system: `Composure` (Health) and `Raw Essence` (In-run Currency).

## **Archived Concept: "Retain Hand" Card Flow**
*   **Date Archived:** Session corresponding to LDD v2.0 simulation phase.
*   **Concept:** The player would keep unplayed cards in their hand at the end of their turn.
*   **Rationale for Archiving:** While this model supports long-term planning, the **"Full Discard" model** was chosen to create a more dynamic, faster-paced tactical experience. It forces the player to solve the puzzle of their hand *each turn*, which better aligns with the *Slay the Spire* inspiration and prevents gameplay from stalling.
